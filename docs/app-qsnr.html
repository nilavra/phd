<p><strong>Invitation to be Part of a Research Study</strong>
Things you should know:</p>
<ul>
<li>The purpose of the study is to identify how search engines can be improved to better support university students’ learning and education.</li>
<li>In order to participate, you must be enrolled in the I303 Ethical Foundations for Informatics course in the Spring 2022 semester.</li>
<li>If you choose to participate, you will be asked, over the course of the semester, to take three surveys (10-15 mins each), attend two Zoom sessions (60-90 mins each), and record browsing activity while working on Final Project Paper. All parts of the study will be conducted online.</li>
<li>Risks or discomforts involved in this research study are not greater than everyday life.</li>
<li>There is no direct benefit for participating in this study.</li>
<li>Taking part in this research study is voluntary. You do not have to participate, and you can stop at any time.</li>
</ul>
<p>More detailed information may be described later in this form.</p>
<p>Please take time to read this entire form and ask questions before deciding whether to take part in this research study.</p>
<p><strong>What is the study about, and why are we doing it?</strong>
The aim of this longitudinal study is to identify how university students search the web for educational research activities. Findings from this study will help to understand how search engines can be improved to better support university students’ learning and education, and therefore help to build more human-centred and learning-centric search systems.</p>
<p><strong>What will happen if you take part in this study?</strong>
If you agree to take part in this study, you will be asked to perform the following activities over the duration of the Spring 2022 semester.</p>
<!-- TODO: insert `study-proc-consent-form.jpeg` -->
<!-- A detailed description of each of the tasks are available at https://longsal.ischool.utexas.edu -->
<p><strong>How long will this study take and how many people will be in the study?</strong>
Participation in this study will take approx. 10-15 minutes each for the three surveys, and 60-90 minutes each for the two synchronous Zoom sessions. There will be about 30-40 participants in total in this study.</p>
<p><strong>What risks and discomforts might you experience from being in this study?</strong>
There are no major foreseeable risks to participating in this study. There may be a very minimal potential risk of confidentiality, or possibly frustrations with some tasks. To address the risk of confidentiality, once data collection is completed, all personally identifying data will be destroyed by erasing all digital files and shredding all the physical records. To address the risk of frustration, you can move at your own pace, or stop whenever you wish.</p>
<p><strong>How could you benefit from this study?</strong>
You will receive no direct benefit from participating in this study; however, this study will help to improve our current understanding of how students search the web for education and learning-related goals over time. This will the development of better learning-centric search systems.</p>
<p><strong>What data will we collect from you?</strong>
As part of this study, we will collect your:</p>
<ul>
<li>audio, screen recordings, and browsing logs when you are participating in the Zoom sessions. You can turn off your face video during these sessions.</li>
<li>browsing log data, when you are performing research for the course final project. You can start and stop the logging when you choose.</li>
<li>anonymized submissions for the final project at various points in the Semester</li>
<li>self-reported grades for the final project assignments that you received</li>
</ul>
<p>The holistic data about your research-assignment related internet search activity, the material that you produce for your assignments, and the scores you receive for those assignments, will help us understand where students perform well, where things can be improved, and how search engines can be improved to better support university students’ learning and education.</p>
<p><strong>How will we protect your information?</strong>
We will protect the privacy and the confidentiality of your data by:</p>
<ul>
<li>Assigning you a coded username at the beginning of the study to protect confidentiality, and all your submitted data will be linked to this coded username.</li>
<li>All digital data generated in the study will be stored via a university-approved secure cloud-based storage service and password-protected computers. All computers used in the project are password protected.</li>
<li>Audio recordings will be listened to only for research purposes. Audio recordings will be transcribed and coded. No information that can be used to uniquely identify an individual will be present</li>
</ul>
<p>We may share your data with other researchers for future research studies that may be similar to this study or maybe very different. In these cases, the data shared with other researchers will NOT include any information that can directly identify you.</p>
<p>We plan to publish the results of this study. To protect your privacy, we will NOT include any information that could directly identify you.</p>
<p><strong>What will happen to the information we collect about you after the study is over?</strong>
We will keep your research data to use for future analyses and publications. Any information that can directly identify you will be deleted from the research data collected as part of the project.</p>
<p><strong>How will we compensate you for being part of the study?</strong>
You will receive up to USD 150 in Amazon Gift cards if you complete all the components of the study, as described above. If you choose to withdraw early from the study, you will receive compensation for the parts you have completed. You will be responsible for any taxes assessed on the compensation.</p>
<p><strong>Your Participation in this Study is Voluntary</strong>
It is totally up to you to decide to be in this research study. Participating in this study is voluntary. Your decision to participate will not affect your relationship with The University of Texas at Austin. You will not lose any benefits or rights you already had if you decide not to participate. Even if you decide to be part of the study now, you may change your mind and stop at any time. You do not have to answer any questions you do not want to answer.</p>
<p><strong>This Study is NOT a part of the I 303 Ethical Foundations of Informatics course:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The study researchers intend to only recruit participants from the student pool enrolled in the course.</li>
<li>The course instructors will not share any student data with the researchers.</li>
<li>The course instructors will not be aware of which students did or did not participate in this study.</li>
<li>Participation in this study is completely voluntary, and in no way affects the outcome of this course for you, or your academic relations with the course instructors.</li>
</ul>
<p>Even after consenting to participate, you can choose to withdraw consent anytime during the semester. We will delete all the data collected from you up to that point. You will receive compensation for the parts you have completed, as outlined above.</p>

<p>Adapted from Intrinsic Motivation Inventory (IMI) <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-ryan1982control">Ryan, 1982</a>)</span>.
Items will be randomly ordered.</p>
<p><strong>Scoring directions:</strong>
Score each response from 1 (not at all true) to 5 (very true).
Then reverse score the items marked with <strong>(R)</strong>.
To do that, subtract the item response from 6, and use the resulting number as the item score.
Then, calculate subscale scores by averaging across all the items on that subscale.
The subscale scores are then used in the analyses of relevant research questions.</p>

<p><strong>Scoring Directions:</strong>
Score each response from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree), and calculate the following seven subscale scores by
summing the items on that subscale.
Items marked <strong>(R)</strong> are reverse-coded (i.e. 1 = strongly agree and 5 = strongly disagree).
To do that, subtract the item response from 6, and use the resulting number as the item score.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>
<em>Receiving relevant information:</em> 1, 8, 15, 22, 29, 36, 43, 50, 57</li>

<p>Based on our clinical and college samples, we tentatively recommend the following ranges for interpreting SRQ total scores with the 63-item scale:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>&gt;= 239</strong>: High (intact) self-regulation capacity (top quartile)</li>
<li>
<strong>214 - 238</strong>: Intermediate (moderate) self-regulation capacity (middle quartiles)</li>
<li>
<strong>&lt;= 213</strong>: Low (impaired) self-regulation capacity (bottom quartile)</li>
