</h2>
<p>LongSAL (Longitudinal Search as Learning study) is a remote, exploratory, longitudinal study that was conducted between January and June 2022 (Spring semester) at the School of Information, University of Texas at Austin (UT Austin).
The study was approved by The University of Texas at Austin Institutional Review Board (Submission ID: <code>STUDY00002136</code>, Date Approved: December 8, 2021).</p>
<p>Participants were recruited from the student pool enrolled in the required undergraduate core-course: <em>Ethical Foundations for Informatics</em> <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-fleischmann2022i303">Fleischmann et al., 2022</a>)</span>.
18 participants originally signed up for the study; 10 participants fully completed all the phases of the study, and the remaining 8 dropped off at different points during the semester.
Students enrolled in the course had to submit a research paper of 2,000-2,500 words as the final project for the course.
There were has four checkpoints spread across the semester to submit the drafts in progress: (i) paper proposal, (ii) outline, (iii) rough draft, and (iv) final paper.
Writing the research paper required choosing an informatics ethical dilemma, and applying three ethical perspectives covered in the course to explore potential solutions to the selected dilemma.
This involved searching and navigating information online, finding at least 20 relevant external sources, combining ideas, and weaving a narration around the information found in the selected sources.</p>
<p>The study design was informed by running a pilot study during Summer
2021 semester, in partnership with two courses at UT Austin School of
Information: <em>Information in Cyberspace</em>, and <em>Academic Success in the
Digital University</em>.
More details of the pilot study are presented in
Appendix <a href="app-pilot-study.html#app-pilot-study">A</a>.</p>

<p>The YASBIL browsing logger <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-bhattacharya2021yasbil">Bhattacharya &amp; Gwizdka, 2021</a>)</span> was utilised
for this study. YASBIL (Yet Another Search Behaviour and Interaction
Logger)<a class="footnote-ref" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/LongSAL/yasbil" class="uri"&gt;https://github.com/LongSAL/yasbil&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>12</sup></a> is a two-component logging solution for ethically recording a
userâ€™s browsing activity for Interactive IR user studies. It was
developed by the author in early Spring 2021, and was employed in the
pilot study for data collection and testing. YASBIL comprises a Firefox
browser extension and a WordPress plugin. The browser extension logs
browsing activity in the participantsâ€™ machines. The WordPress plugin
collects the logged data into the researcherâ€™s data server. YASBIL
captures participantâ€™s behavioural data, such as webpage visits, time
spent on pages, identification of popular search engines and their
SERPs,
<!-- identifying rank of result clicked on SERPs,  -->
tracking mouse
clicks and scrolls, and the order and sequences of these events. The
logging works on any webpage, without the need to own or have knowledge
about the HTML structure of the webpage. To protect the privacy of
participants, the logger software can be switched on or off by the participant.
Participants received regular reminders to turn YASBIL on only when they were searching for information related to the course.</p>
<!-- and participants will be instructed (and encouraged) to switch on the logger only when they are performing search activities related to the experiment.  -->
<p>YASBIL offers ethical data transparency and security
for participants, by enabling them to view and obtain copies of the
logged data, as well as securely upload the data to the researcherâ€™s
server over an HTTPS connection. Although developed using the
cross-browser WebExtension API <a class="footnote-ref" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/Build-a-cross-browser-extension" class="uri"&gt;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/Build-a-cross-browser-extension&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>13</sup></a>, YASBIL
currently works in the Firefox Web Browser. So participants were
instructed to install Firefox and YASBIL on their machines when they
volunteered to participate in the study.</p>

<p>The longitudinal study consisted of six data collection components, as illustrated in Figure <a href="method-longsal---the-longitudinal-study.html#fig:study-proc">5.1</a>.
They comprise three asynchronous <strong>questionnaires</strong> (<code>QSNR1</code>, <code>QSNR2</code>, <code>QSNR3</code>),
two <strong>remote synchronous study phases</strong> over Zoom video conferencing software (<code>PHASE1</code>, <code>PHASE3</code>),
and a set of four asynchronous <strong>longitudinal tracking phases</strong> (<code>PHASE2a</code>, <code>PHASE2b</code>, <code>PHASE2c</code>, <code>PHASE2d</code>).
These phases are discussed in detail in the following sections.

false questionnaire, and later revised by <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-terlecki2018call">Terlecki &amp; McMahon, 2018</a>)</span> to use
five-point Likert scales. The instrument measures two components of
cognition through self-report: knowledge about cognition, and
regulation of cognition (Section <a href="ch-bg-learn.html#sec-bg-learn-metacognition">2.5.2</a>).</p>
<p>After completing QSNR1 offline, participants were instructed to prepare
for the initial synchronous phase, <code>PHASE1</code>, by
installing Firefox web browser and the YASBIL extension on their machines.
<!-- *(ii)* get a quick introduction to concept maps (by watching a short video),
*(ii)* familiarizing themselves with the *Sero!* learning platform
(for creating and assessing concept maps).  -->
This was a one-time step.
If a
participant could not find the time for this step, they were informed
that an extra 5-10 minutes would be taken in the beginning of <code>PHASE1</code> to
complete this step.</p>
<p>The entry questionnaire and the software installation took about
10-15 minutes to complete. Participants were compensated with USD 5
for their time for completing this step. The questionnaire was published to the I-303 course students in
the first week of the Spring 2022 semester.

<p>Participants performed two search tasks: <code>PHASE1-FINANCE</code>, and <code>PHASE1-UBUNTU</code>.
The <code>PHASE1-FINANCE</code> task was repeated at the end of the semester as <code>PHASE3-FINANCE</code> task.
The <code>PHASE1-UBUNTU</code> task was not repeated, and instead the <code>PHASE3-BIAS</code> task tooK its place.
This helps to answer the research question RQ2 (Chapter <a href="ch-rq.html#ch-rq">4</a>).
The order of the two search tasks were randomized.</p>
<p>The repeated search task <code>FINANCE</code> was on the topic of financial literacy, a topic that we posit can be considered as universally important to college students, and part of lifelong learning.
The prompts for the <code>PHASE1-FINANCE</code> and <code>PHASE3-FINANCE</code> tasks are presented in Figure <a href="method-longsal---the-longitudinal-study.html#fig:search-task-repeated">5.2</a>.
The non-repeated search tasks were on topics that were taught in the I303 course:
Ubuntu ethics (for <code>PHASE1</code>)
and
Algorithmic Bias (for <code>PHASE3</code>).
The prompts for these tasks are present in Figure <a href="method-longsal---the-longitudinal-study.html#fig:search-task-new">5.3</a>.</p>

To answer RQ3 (effect of externalization and articulation in learning), each participant performed one of the search tasks while thinking aloud (Concurrent-Think Aloud or *CTA condition*), and performed the other search task in silence (*silent condition*).

-->
<p>Each search task began with a pre-task questionnaire (Appendix <a href="app-phase13.html#app-phase13-pretask">C.1</a>), which asked participants to self-rate their pre-search knowledge-level and interest on the topic.
Then participants turned on the YASBIL browsing logger and started searching.
The deliverable for each search task was a written summary (artefact).
After participants are satisfied with the quality of the deliverable, they turned off YASBIL browsing logger, and proceeded to the post-task questionnaire.</p>
<p>The post-task questionnaire (Appendix <a href="app-phase13.html#app-phase13-posttask">C.2</a>) asked participants to self-rate their perceived learning and search outcomes, search experience, interest and motivation, and overall perceptions.
The pre-task and post-task questionnaires are adapted from <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-collins2016assessing">Collins-Thompson et al., 2016</a>; <a href="#ref-crescenzi2020adaptation">Crescenzi, 2020</a>)</span>.</p>
<!-- 


After the two search tasks were completed, participants answered questions about whether they preferred the think-aloud condition or the silent condition, and why (Appendix \@ref(app-phase13-cta-v-silent)).


#### `PHASE1-SHEG`: Website Reliability Assessment

To assess participants' (mis)information evaluation capabilities, participants performed a website reliability assessment created by the @sheg2021website-reliability.

> *This task presents students with the website of the American College of Pediatricians (ACPeds.org) and asks them whether it is a trustworthy source to learn about childrenâ€™s health. Despite the siteâ€™s professional title and appearance, the American College of Pediatricians is not the nationâ€™s major professional organization of pediatricians. That designation belongs to the similarly named American Academy of Pediatrics.*
>
> *This exercise is an open web search in which students are free to stay on the American College of Pediatricians site or leave it to search for information about the group. Successful students will look beyond the surface features of the site and detect its agenda from its new releases or other focus issues. A faster route, however, is to leave the site almost immediately to search for reliable information about the true agenda of this organization.*

<p><code>PHASE1</code> concluded with the assessment of the participantâ€™s working memory capacity (WMC) using a memory span task <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-francis2004coglab">Francis et al., 2004</a>)</span>.
Memory span assessment was kept in the synchronous phase because it is a timed task, and needs to conducted in a controlled (experimenter observed) condition.
The task has 25 trials. On each trial participants saw a list of items presented one at a time in random order and were asked to recall the items in the same order in which they were presented. If they got a list correct, the list length increased by 1 for that type of material. If they got a list incorrect, the list length decreased by 1.</p>
<p>The type of material participants were asked to recall were: digits, letters that sound dissimilar, letters that sound similar, short words, and long words. The outcome score was the list length of the last list that participants could correctly recall.</p>

<p>The four-part longitudinal tracking phases <code>PHASE2A</code> - <code>PHASE2D</code> were conducted asynchronously over the duration of the semester, to understand the change (or lack thereof) of participantsâ€™ search behaviour and knowledge gain over time.
Whenever participants worked on different parts of their final project (Ethical dilemma research paper for the I-303 course), as described in Figure <a href="method-longsal---the-longitudinal-study.html#fig:final-project-description">5.4</a>, they used Firefox web browser, and logged their browsing activity using YASBIL browsing logger.
To protect their privacy, participants were regularly instructed to turn YASBIL on only when they were searching for information related to coursework.
After each checkpoint assignment, participants self-uploaded an anonymized version of the working-draft of their research paper, and answered a post-task questionnaire.
The post-task questionnaire were similar to those used in the <code>PHASE1</code> and <code>PHASE3</code> search tasks, where participants self-reported, among other things, their perceived learning outcome and perceived search outcome <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-collins2016assessing">Collins-Thompson et al., 2016</a>)</span>.
Participants received reminder emails before the deadline of each assignment, to remind them to use Firefox, turn YASBIL on, and upload the anonymized working-draft.
To prevent participant drop-off, a staggered payment model was adopted during PHASE2.
Participants received USD 5 each when they completed <code>PHASE2A</code> and <code>PHASE2B</code>, USD 10 for <code>PHASE2C</code>, and USD 15 for <code>PHASE2D</code>, for a total of USD 35 for entire <code>PHASE2</code>.

</h3>
<p>The mid-term questionnaire <code>QSNR2</code> took place around the mid-point of the semester (Week 8-9).
The purpose was to track whether any of the participantsâ€™ individual difference measures (motivation, metacognition, and self-regulation) changed during the first half of the semester.
This questionnaire was essentially a replica of the Entry Questionnaire <code>QSNR1</code>, with two modifications. First, the consent form and the demographics sections were absent.
Second, the Intrinsic Motivation Inventory (IMI) included the â€˜pressure/tensionâ€™ and the â€˜perceived choiceâ€™ subscales, as these scales are more meaningful after an activity has taken place <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-ryan1982control">Ryan, 1982</a>)</span>.

#### `PHASE3-SHEG`: Website Comparison Assessment

Following the two search tasks, participants performed another website comparison assessment from the @sheg2021webpage-comparison. This task assessed their evolved information evaluation skills. 

To assess participants' (mis)information evaluation capabilities, they performed a Website Comparison assessment created by the @sheg2021webpage-comparison.

> *This task instructed participants to compare two websites and select the one that they would use to begin research on a topic. One of the pages is a Wikipedia article. The other has ".edu" in its URL, but the page reveals that the content is a student-written blog post created as part of a university course. Many students have been taught that Wikipedia pages are unreliable and should be avoided. Many have also been taught that sites with a .edu domain are trustworthy. This assessment gauges their ability to think in more nuanced ways about these kinds of websites.*

## Measurement and Variables

### Independent / Explanatory: Search Interaction and Process Measures

The independent variables will be the search process behavioural
measures. Information searching behaviour will be operationalized using
a battery of search process measures, based on the three-stages of user
interaction discussed in Section
[\[sec-bg-search-3\-stage\]](#sec-bg-search-3-stage){reference-type="ref"
reference="sec-bg-search-3-stage"}. These measures include query
reformulation types and measures
(TableÂ [\[tab-res-Q\-QRT-txnmy\]](#tab-res-Q-QRT-txnmy){reference-type="ref"
reference="tab-res-Q-QRT-txnmy"}), SERP examination measures, content
page examination measures, and overall search session measures (Table
[\[tab-search-behaviours\]](#tab-search-behaviours){reference-type="ref"
reference="tab-search-behaviours"}). A non-exhaustive list of such
search process measures which have been used in prior literature is
presented in Appendices
[\[sec-app-vars-qry\]](#sec-app-vars-qry){reference-type="ref"
reference="sec-app-vars-qry"} through
[\[sec-app-vars-overall-search\]](#sec-app-vars-overall-search){reference-type="ref"
reference="sec-app-vars-overall-search"}.

### Dependant / Outcome: Learning Measures

Learning (knowledge gain) will constitute the dependant variables, or
factor variables, when dichotomized via median split. Learning outcomes
are planned to be assessed by: *(i)* analysis of concept maps
[@halttunen2005assessing] (Appendix
[\[sec-app-vars-concept-maps\]](#sec-app-vars-concept-maps){reference-type="ref"
reference="sec-app-vars-concept-maps"}); *(ii)* analysis of written
summaries / knowledge artefacts [@wilson2013comparison]; and *(iii)*
instructor awarded scores and grades received by students in the course,
which will be obtained via FERPA release. Time, resources and
feasibility permitting, other possible ways of assessing learning can be
by using *(iv)* Online Research and Comprehension Assessment (ORCA)
[@leu2015new Table 3], [@kanniainen2021assessing Appendix A]; and *(v)*
information-use from websites in written artefacts
[@vakkari2019modeling; @vakkari2020usefulness].

### Moderator: Individual Differences

The variables of individual differences that are hypothesized to
moderate learning are *(i)* motivation, scored using Intrinsic
Motivation Inventory (IMI) [@ryan1982control]; *(ii)* self-regulation,
scored using Self-Regulation Questionnaire (SRQ) [@brown1999self];
*(iii)* metacognition, scored using revised Metacognivite Awareness
Inventory (MAI) [@schraw1994assessing; @terlecki2018call] *(iv)* memory
span, scored using memory span test [@francis2004coglab]; *(v)* search
proficiency, scored using Digital Health Literacy Instrument (DHLI)
[@van2017development] and Search Self-Efficacy Scale (SSE)
[@brennan2016factor]; *(vi)* information evaluation capabilities
(mastery / emerging / beginner), scored according to rubrics provided by
[@sheg2021webpage-comparison] assessments (an example grading rubric is
present in Appendix
[\[sec-app-pilot-ses3\]](#sec-app-pilot-ses3){reference-type="ref"
reference="sec-app-pilot-ses3"} Task 3).

## Data Analysis Plans

Exploratory data analysis (such as time series plotting) and descriptive
statistics will be used to identify if changes in search process /
interaction measures can be visually observed over the course of time.
Inferential statistics (difference between groups) will be employed to
test if there are significant differences in the learning measures
between student groups who learn more versus learn less. Pattern Mining
and clustering approaches may also be used to identify clusters or
patterns in the search process (time-series) data, and see if these
clusters correlate with high and low learning. An example of measuring
such changes in variables can be found in [@133 Section 3.2]. Advanced
search interactions such as parallel browsing behaviour (multi-tabbed
and multi-windowed browsing) may also be analysed
[@huang2010parallel; @labaj2012modeling].

## Anticipated Limitations

There are foreseeable limitations to this proposed longitudinal study.
First, there may not be enough participants who sign up for the study.
The remedy for this is choosing a course with a large number of
students, and using appealing messaging in the recruitment material
(e.g., an attractive video message was used to recruit participants in
the Pilot Study[^2]). Second, participants may drop off due to various
reasons during the study. This can be tackled by regularly communicating
with the participants, keeping them engaged with affectionate, caring
and encouraging messaging, and letting them know that their
participation is valued highly by the researchers. Third, participants
may not show any changes in their search behaviours, of the changes may
be random. As one anonymous reviewer put it "the smart kids will show up
smart and with good search skills and they will leave smart with good
search skills and they will not change their inherent behavior over the
time. Similarly, the dumb kids will show up dumb, do whatever keeps them
dumb and end up dumb." Alternatively, there may be are not changes over
time, but rather strategies that are consistently followed by students
who will learn more, and students who will learn less. There is no easy
fix to this, and if this happens, it will be treated as a finding from
the study. A possible rescue from this situation would then be to use
the (semi) qualitative data -- the semi structured interview at the end,
the concurrent think alouds, and others -- to derive interesting
findings.
