**Scoring Directions:**
Score each response from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree), and calculate the following seven subscale scores by
summing the items on that subscale.
Items marked **(R)** are reverse-coded (i.e. 1 = strongly agree and 5 = strongly disagree).
To do that, subtract the item response from 6, and use the resulting number as the item score.

1. *Receiving relevant information:* 1, 8, 15, 22, 29, 36, 43, 50, 57
2. *Evaluating the information and comparing it to norms:* 2, 9, 16, 23, 30, 37, 44, 51, 58

Based on our clinical and college samples, we tentatively recommend the following ranges for interpreting SRQ total scores with the 63-item scale:

- **>= 239**: High (intact) self-regulation capacity (top quartile)
- **214 - 238**: Intermediate (moderate) self-regulation capacity (middle quartiles)
- **<= 213**: Low (impaired) self-regulation capacity (bottom quartile)
