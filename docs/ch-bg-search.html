<p>This second chapter on background literature discusses relevant concepts
from the disciplines of Information Sciences, and more specifically
Interaction Information Retrieval. First, we introduce some terminology
around information behaviour, information need, and information
relevance. Then we discuss relevant findings various empirical studies,
from the lens of three-stage interactions in the information search
process. Then we discuss some overall generic characteristics of
information search behaviour, and how they are linked to expertise and
working memory. Next we discuss how learning has been assessed in recent
search-as-learning studies. We also discuss some limitations of current
search systems to foster learning, including the lack of sufficient
number of longitudinal studies. In the last section, we state what
implications these findings have for shaping the proposed study in this
dissertation proposal.</p>

</h2>
<p><strong>Information retrieval</strong> (IR) is the process of obtaining <em>information
objects</em>, that are <em>relevant</em> to an <em>information need</em>, from a
collection of those objects (Wikipedia). <strong>Information objects</strong> are
entities that can potentially convey information. They can take many
forms, such as documents, webpages, facts, music, spoken words, images,
videos, artefacts, and other forms of human expression. Areas where
information retrieval techniques are employed include search engines,
such as web search, social search, and desktop search; media search, as
in image, music, video; digital libraries and recommender systems, as
well as domain specific applications like geographical information
systems, e-Commerce websites, legal information search, and others.</p>
<p>Multiple perspectives exist around how users interact with information,
and IR systems. In the <strong>Search Engine application view</strong>, the
interactions are restricted to the search engine interface. In the
<strong>Human-computer interaction</strong> (HCI) view, interactions are between a
person and a system; but the system can go <em>beyond</em> supporting only
retrieval, to supporting more complex tasks. In the <strong>cognitive view of
IR</strong>, which is the broadest, the interactions for obtaining information
can be between a person and a system, as well as between people, for
retrieval of information.</p>

<p>People’s behaviour around information can be modelled as a nested Venn
diagram as proposed by <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-wilson1999models">T. D. Wilson, 1999</a>)</span> (Figure
<a href="#fig-wilson-info-behaviour"><strong>??</strong></a>). <strong>Information behaviour</strong> is
the more general field of investigation. <strong>Information-seeking
behaviour</strong> can be seen as a sub-set of the field, particularly
concerned with the variety of methods people employ to discover, and
gain access to information objects. <strong>Information search behaviour</strong> is
yet a sub-set of information-seeking, concerned with the interactions
between the user and computer-based information systems. In this
dissertation, we focus on information search rather than the other two
higher hierarchical concepts. This is because online IR systems, such as
search engines or digital libraries, have become the primary source for
people to obtain information in modern times, and web search is becoming
ever more pervasive and ubiquitious in our day to day lives.</p>
<p>The field of <strong>interactive information retrieval</strong> (IIR) posits that IR
systems should operate in the way that good libraries do. Good libraries
provide both the information a visitor needs, as well as a <em>partner</em> in
the learning process — the information professional — to navigate
that information, make sense of it, preserve it, and turn it into
knowledge. As early as in 1980, Bertram Brookes stated that searchers
acquire new knowledge in the information seeking process
<span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-brookes1980foundations">Brookes, 1980</a>)</span>. Fifteen years later, Gary Marchionini
described information seeking, as <em>“a process, in which humans
purposefully engage in order to change their state of knowledge”</em>
<span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-marchionini1995information">Marchionini, 1995</a>)</span>. So we have known for quite a while that
search is driven by the higher-level human need to gain knowledge.
Information Retrieval is thus a means to an end, and not the end in
itself. Thus, the ideal IR system should not only help users to locate
information, but also help them to <strong>bridge the gap between information
and knowledge</strong>.</p>
<p>This brings us to the concept of information need. <strong>Information Need</strong>
is the desire to locate and obtain information to satisfy a conscious or
unconscious human need. Most search systems of today assume that the
search query is an accurate representation of a user’s information need.
However, <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-belkin1982ask">Belkin et al., 1982</a>)</span> observed that in many cases, users of search
systems are unable to precisely formulate what they need. They miss some
vital knowledge to formulate their queries. As humans, we have
difficulty in asking questions about what we do not know. Belkin called
this phenomenon as <strong>Anomalous State of Knowledge</strong>, or ASK. Later,
<span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-huang2013relevance">Huang &amp; Soergel, 2013</a>)</span> identified an exhaustive set of criteria that
should be considered in order to ideally represent a user’s information
need. These criteria for information need are highly dependent on the
user context: user attributes, tasks or goals, as well as the situation
the user is embedded in. This brings us to another closely related
concept: information relevance.</p>
<p><strong>Relevance</strong> is a fundamental concept of Information Science and
Information Retrieval, and perhaps the most celebrated work in this area
has been done by Tefko Saracevic
<span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-saracevic1975relevance">Saracevic, 1975</a>, <a href="#ref-saracevic2007relevance">2007a</a>, <a href="#ref-saracevic2007relevancea">2007b</a>, <a href="#ref-saracevic2016notion">2016</a>)</span>.
Webster dictionary define relevance as “a relation to the matter at
hand”. In most circumstances, relevance is a “y’know” notion. People
apply it effortlessly, without anybody having to define for them what
“relevance” is. This creates one of the most fascinating challenges in
the information field: humans understand relevance intuitively, while it
is an open research problem to represent relevance effectively for use
by algorithmic systems. The situation becomes more interesting because
relevance always depends on context, and the context is ever dynamic, as
the matter at hand changes.</p>

<p>As we saw in the previous section, information search behaviour is the
(study of) interactions between a user, and digital Information
Retrieval (IR) systems. The field of Information Science/Studies has
developed multiple models explaining how information search works
<span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-wilson1999models">T. D. Wilson, 1999</a>)</span>. A few of them are presented in Figure
<a href="#fig-info-search-models"><strong>??</strong></a>. Across many of these models, we
observe that most major Information Retrieval (IR) systems have three
fundamental ways of letting users interact with the system, and the
underlying information: <em>(1)</em> an interface for entering search
<strong>queries</strong>; <em>(2)</em> an interface for viewing and evaluating a <strong>list</strong> of
retrieved information-objects, or search results; <em>(3)</em> an interface for
viewing and evaluating <strong>individual information-objects</strong>. For instance,
<span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-marchionini1995information">Marchionini, 1995</a>)</span>’s ISP model hints at these three
interfaces in the fourth, sixth and seventh stages, namely “formulate
query”, “examine results”, and “extract info”. <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-spink1997study">Spink, 1997</a>)</span>’s model
of the IR interaction process consists of sequential steps or cycles,
and each cycle comprises one or more interactive feedback occurrences of
user input (query), IR system output (list), and user interpretation and
judgement (of individual information-objects). Consequently, findings
from the large body of empirical research in interactive IR (especially
those with web based search systems) can be grouped around these thee
stages of interactions with search systems:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>
<em>Stage 1:</em> search query formulation / reformulation</li>
<li>
<em>Stage 2:</em> search results evaluation (or source selection)</li>
<li>
<em>Stage 3:</em> content page evaluation (or, interacting with sources)</li>
</ol>
<p>The discussions in the following subsections are based around these
three stages of interactions. The empirical studies discussed below
generally follow some common principles of user studies in Interactive
IR (IIR) <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-borlund2013interactive">Borlund, 2013</a>; <a href="#ref-kelly2009methods">Kelly, 2009</a>)</span>: participants are
presented with a search task or search topic, and then they are asked to
search the internet (or a simulation of the open web) for information.
During the search, the various interactions (queries, clicks, webpages
opened etc.) are recorded, and these are analysed and correlated with
other sources of data to answer research questions.</p>

<span class="header-section-number">3.2.1</span> Stage 1: Query (Re)formulation<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#sec-bg-search-query"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p><em>How do users behave when submitting search queries (to an IR system)?</em></p>
<p><strong>Query formulation</strong> is the process of composing a search query that
describes the information need of a searcher. <strong>Query reformulation</strong>
refers to the act of either modifying a previous query, or creating a
new query. Query reformulation typically occurs due to a searcher’s
improved understanding of how to better translate their information need
into a search query. The relationship between two successively issued
queries have been classified in a number of ways. These classifications
are called <em>Query Reformulation Types</em>, or QRTs. Amongst many other,
<span class="citation">Boldi et al. (<a href="#ref-boldi2009dango">2009</a>)</span> used cognitive aspects of the searchers issuing the
query to propose a taxonomy of QRTs, while <span class="citation">C. Liu et al. (<a href="#ref-liu2010analysis">2010</a>)</span> proposed a
similar taxonomy focusing more on the linguistic properties of the two
successive queries. These are compared and contrasted in
Table <a href="#tab-res-Q-QRT-txnmy"><strong>??</strong></a>.</p>

<p>Task-type, task-topic, task-goal, and domain-expertise were found to
influence query reformulation patterns of searchers <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-127">Eickhoff et al., 2015</a>; <a href="#ref-126">Jiang et al., 2014</a>; <a href="#ref-133">Mao et al., 2018</a>)</span>.
At first glance, a significant portion of the query reformulation terms
(<span class="math inline">\(\sim86\%\)</span>) seemed to be coming from the task-description itself
<span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-126">Jiang et al., 2014</a>; <a href="#ref-133">Mao et al., 2018</a>)</span>. This was characterized by significantly more fixations on
the task-description, rather than other SERP elements. <span class="citation">Jiang et al. (<a href="#ref-126">2014</a>)</span> and <span class="citation">Mao et al. (<a href="#ref-133">2018</a>)</span>
investigated this phenomenon further. <span class="citation">Jiang et al. (<a href="#ref-126">2014</a>)</span> controlled for the task-type
and task-goal, using the faceted-framework by <span class="citation">Li &amp; Belkin (<a href="#ref-li2008faceted">2008</a>)</span>. <span class="citation">Mao et al. (<a href="#ref-133">2018</a>)</span>
controlled for the task-topic and the domain-expertise of the searchers.</p>
<p>If search tasks had <em>factual</em> goals, searchers relied heavily on the
task-description for reformulating their queries <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-126">Jiang et al., 2014</a>)</span>. For
<em>interpretive</em> tasks (intellectual tasks with specific goals), users
spent more time reading search result surrogates, before reformulating
their queries. This was observed by increased eye-fixations (indicative
of visual attention) and dwell time on search result snippets
(surrogates). For exploratory tasks, searchers fixated the longest on
query-autocompletion (QAC) suggestions, indicating that they were
possibly looking for help and suggestion based on their specific query,
as the search-task had non-specific (amorphous) goals.</p>
<p>Searchers also relied on the task-description for reformulating queries,
when the search-task was outside their domain of expertise <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-133">Mao et al., 2018</a>)</span>. For
in-domain tasks, they used query terms from their own knowledge, that
were not fixated on in visited SERPs and content pages. <span class="citation">Eickhoff et al. (<a href="#ref-127">2015</a>)</span> reported
that a significant share of new query terms came from visited SERPs and
content pages, and query reformulation (specialization) often did not
literally re-use previously encountered terms, but highly related
ones <a class="footnote-ref" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content='&lt;p&gt;
measured using Leacock-Chodorow semantic similarity metric &lt;span class="citation"&gt;(&lt;a href="#ref-leacock1998combining"&gt;Leacock &amp;amp; Chodorow, 1998&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>8</sup></a> instead. These observations can possibly be explained by <span class="citation">Mao et al. (<a href="#ref-133">2018</a>)</span>’s
findings: when exploring a new domain, the searcher may accumulate
vocabulary and learn how to query during the search; when performing
in-domain search-tasks, the searcher may have enough prior knowledge to
come up with effective query terms. It was also seen that searchers from
medicine domain used more unread query terms for their in-domain
search-tasks, compared to politics and environment domains <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-133">Mao et al., 2018</a>)</span>. This
suggested that domain knowledge and expertise is more important for
formulating good search queries in highly technical disciplines (e.g.,
medicine), compared to less technical domains (e.g., politics).</p>
<p><strong>Query Auto Completion (QAC)</strong> is a technological feature that suggests
possible queries to web search users from the moment they start typing a
query. It is nearly ubiquitous in modern search systems, and is thought
to reduce physical and cognitive effort when formulating a query. QAC
suggestions are usually displayed as a list
(Figure <a href="#fig-int-Q"><strong>??</strong></a>(b)
and (c)), and users interact in a variety of ways with the list. <span class="citation">Hofmann et al. (<a href="#ref-125">2014</a>)</span>
observed a strong position bias among searchers who examined the QAC
list: the top suggestions received the highest visual attention, even
when the ordering of the suggestions were randomized. Average fixation
time decreased consistently on suggested items from top to bottom. Even
when the ranking of suggestions were randomized, time taken to formulate
queries did not significantly differ.</p>
<p>Search topics were found to have a large effect on QAC usage
<span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-126">Jiang et al., 2014</a>; <a href="#ref-129">Smith et al., 2016</a>)</span>. Search was easiest for the topics with the highest QAC
usage. Total eye-gaze duration was longest when visual attention was
shared between the QAC suggestions and the actual search query input
box. Some additional time was probably due to decision making on whether
to use a QAC suggestion. Typing was faster when a QAC was not used.
However, the IR system’s retrieval performance (measured using <a href="mailto:NDCG@3" class="email">NDCG@3</a>),
was greater when QAC was used. So <span class="citation">Smith et al. (<a href="#ref-129">2016</a>)</span> speculated that the value of
using QAC suggestions was realized later in the search session by users,
when they saw a reduction in the number of additional queries needed, or
an increase in the value of the information found.</p>
<p>Several user behavioural profiles were identified by exploring
associations between visual attention from eye-tracking, search
interactions from mouse and keyboard activity, and the use of QAC
suggestions <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-125">Hofmann et al., 2014</a>; <a href="#ref-129">Smith et al., 2016</a>)</span>. These profiles are described in
Table <a href="#tab-res-Q-QAC-profiles"><strong>??</strong></a>. An interesting, yet common-sense
observation was that participants’ touch-typing ability greatly
influenced their interactions with QAC suggestions.</p>
<p>The native language of searchers was found to influence their overall
querying and searching behaviour. <span class="citation">Ling et al. (<a href="#ref-132">2018</a>)</span> explored this space using four
variations of a multi-lingual search interface. They observed that
participants strongly preferred to issue queries in their first or
native language. A second or non-native language was the next preferred
choice. Mixing of first and second-languages occurred very rarely. In
80% of the total 300 tasks (25 users <span class="math inline">\(\times\)</span> 4 interfaces <span class="math inline">\(\times\)</span> 3
task-types), participants used a single language for querying. In the
rest 20% of the tasks, participants switched languages for querying,
with a transition from first language to second language being the most
common.</p>

(returned by an IR system)?</em></p>
<p>After a user submits a query to an IR system, the next action they
generally perform is examining and evaluating the list of search results
returned by the IR system. In this section, we discuss empirical studies
which investigated information-searching behaviour around a list of
information-objects, or a representation of information-objects (also
called <em>surrogates</em>). We identified some common themes in the research
questions investigated. The discussion below is grouped along these
themes, as relationships between search behaviour and: <em>(i)</em> ranking of
search results; <em>(ii)</em> information shown in search results; <em>(iii)</em>
individual user characteristics; and <em>(iv)</em> relevance judgement and
feedback.</p>

<!--  \
**Relationships between [ranking of search results]{.underline}, and
search behaviour:** -->
<p>Most search engines display results in a rank ordered list, with the
highest <em>algorithmically</em> relevant results placed at the top, and others
results ordered below. <span class="citation">Granka et al. (<a href="#ref-101">2004</a>; <a href="#ref-108">Lorigo et al., 2008</a>)</span> studied eye-movement behaviour of
searchers examining SERPs, and reported observations from three user
studies. They saw that in 96% of the queries, participants looked at
only the first result page, containing the top 10 results. No
participant looked beyond the third result page for a given query.
Participants looked primarily at the first few results, with nearly
equal attention (dwell time) given to the first and the second results.
However, despite equal attention, the first result was clicked 42% of
the time, while the second was clicked only 8% of the time. If none of
the top three results appeared to be relevant, then users chose not to
explore further results, but issued a reformulated query instead. When
the ranking of the search results were reversed (i.e. placing less
relevant results in the higher ranked positions), participants spent
considerably more time scrutinizing and comparing results (more
fixations and regressions) before making a decision to click or
reformulate.</p>
<p>Some effects of gender were found to influence SERP examination <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-108">Lorigo et al., 2008</a>)</span>.
Females clicked on the second result twice as often, and made more
regressions or repeat viewings of already visited abstracts, compared to
males. Males were more likely to click on lower ranked results, from
entries 7 through 10, and also look beyond the first 10 results
significantly more often than women. Males were also more linear in
their scanning patterns, with less regressions. Pupil dilation did not
differ significantly between gender groups.</p>
<p>Effects of task-type and task-goals also influenced SERP examination
behaviour. <span class="citation">Guan &amp; Cutrell (<a href="#ref-105">2007</a>)</span> used <span class="citation">Broder (<a href="#ref-broder2002taxonomy">2002</a>)</span>’s taxonomy of navigational vs.
informational searches. The authors reported that when users could not
find the target results for navigational searches, they either selected
the first result, or switched to a new query. However, for informational
searches, users rarely issued a new query and were more likely to try
out the top-ranked results, even when those results had lower relevance
to the task. This illustrated possible strong confidence of searchers in
the search engine’s relevance ranking, even though searchers clearly saw
target results at lower positions. Thus, people were more likely to
deprecate their own sense of objective relevance and obeyed the ranking
determined by the search engine. <span class="citation">Jiang et al. (<a href="#ref-126">2014</a>)</span> used <span class="citation">Li &amp; Belkin (<a href="#ref-li2008faceted">2008</a>)</span>’s framework of
search-tasks, and saw that in tasks having specific goals, searchers
fixated more on lower ranked results after some time. On the other hand,
for tasks having amorphous goals, there was a wider breadth in viewing
the SERP, and less effort spent in viewing the content pages. Fixations
tended to decrease as search session progressed, indicating decreased
interest and increasing mental effort, which could demonstrate
<em>satisficing</em> behaviour <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-simon1956rational">Simon, 1956</a>)</span>. A comprehensive overview
of various behavioural traits associated with task-types and task-goals
can be found in <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-126">Jiang et al., 2014</a> Table 8)</span>.</p>

</h4>
<!--  \
**Relationships between [information shown in search
results]{.underline}, and search behaviour:** -->
<p>The amount and quality of different kinds of information shown on SERPs
also affected user’s information searching behaviour. <span class="citation">Cutrell &amp; Guan (<a href="#ref-104">2007</a>)</span> saw that as
the length of the surrogate information (result snippets) was increased,
user’s search performance improved for informational tasks, but degraded
for navigational tasks <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-broder2002taxonomy">Broder, 2002</a>)</span>. Analyzing eye-tracking
data, they posited that the difference in performance was due to users
paying more attention to the snippet, and less attention to the URL
located at the bottom of the search result. This led to performance
deterioration in navigational searches. <span class="citation">Buscher et al. (<a href="#ref-115">2010</a>)</span> studied the effects of the
quality of advertisements placed in the SERPs (Figure <a href="#fig-int-L-serp"><strong>??</strong></a>(b)). Similar to findings discussed above, a
strong position bias of visual attention was found towards the top few
organic result entries — the well known F-shaped pattern of visual
attention — which was stronger for informational than for navigational
tasks. However, a strong bias <em>against</em> sponsored links was observed in
general. Even for informational tasks, where participants generally had
a harder time finding a solution, the ads did not receive any additional
attention from the participants. <span class="citation">Lorigo et al. (<a href="#ref-108">2008</a>)</span> compared the visual attention
patterns of searchers using two different search engines: Google, and
Yahoo!. Behavioural trends followed similar patterns for both search
engines, even though Google was rated as the primary search engine of
all but one of the participants. They found slight variations in some
eye-tracking measures (reading time of surrogates, time to click
results, and query reformulation time), and some self-reported measures
(perceived ease of use, perceived satisfaction, and success rate).
However, none of these differences were statistically significant.</p>
<p>The novel query-preview interface by <span class="citation">Qvarfordt et al. (<a href="#ref-121">2013</a>)</span> was discussed in
Section <a href="ch-bg-search.html#sec-bg-search-query">3.2.1</a> and in
Figure <a href="#fig-int-Q"><strong>??</strong></a>(a).
The authors also reported several observations about user behaviour on
SERPs. They saw that the presence of the preview visualization enabled
participants to look deeper into the results lists. Participants tried
to use the preview as a navigation tool, although it was not designed as
such. The tool increased the rates at which participants examined
documents at middle ranks in query results, and thus helped discover
more useful documents in those middle ranks than without the preview
widget. The preview tool also helped to increase the diversity of
documents found in a search session, which could in turn lead to better
performance in terms of recall and precision. Thus, the tool helped
searchers overcome the strong position bias towards top-ranked results,
as observed by other studies discussed previously.</p>

</h4>
<!--  \
**Relationships between [individual user characteristics]{.underline},
and search behaviour:** -->
<p>Individual traits of searchers also influence their pattern of
interactions with a SERP, and these patterns can be revealed by
analyzing eye-tracking data. For instance, searchers have been
classified as <em>economic</em> vs. <em>exhaustive</em>, based on their style of
evaluating SERPs <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-102">Aula et al., 2005</a>)</span>. <em>Economic</em> searchers were found to scan less
than half (three) of the displayed results above the fold, before making
their first action (query re-formulation, or following a link).
<em>Exhaustive</em> searchers evaluated more than half of the visible results
above the fold, or even scrolled the results page to view all of the
results, before performing the first action. Thus, economic searchers
demonstrated depth-first search strategy, while exhaustive users
favoured the breadth-first approach
(Figure <a href="#fig-res-L-serp-user-chars"><strong>??</strong></a>(a)). <span class="citation">Dumais et al. (<a href="#ref-117">2010</a>)</span> demonstrated the use of
unsupervised clustering to re-identify the <em>economic</em>-<em>exhaustive</em> user
groups, based on differences in total fixation impact <a class="footnote-ref" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content='&lt;p&gt;
a measure derived from eye fixation durations, proposed by &lt;span class="citation"&gt;Buscher et al. (&lt;a href="#ref-110"&gt;2009&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>9</sup></a>, scanpaths,
task outcomes, and questionnaire data. The <em>economic</em> cluster was
further broken down by users who looked primarily at results
(<em>economic-results</em> cluster), and users who viewed both results and ads
(<em>economic-ads</em> cluster). All three groups spent the highest amount of
time on the first three results, with the <em>exhaustive</em> group being
substantially slower than the other two groups. The <em>exhaustive</em> and
<em>economic-results</em> groups spent the second-highest amount of time on
results four through six, while the <em>economic-eds</em> group spent this time
on the main advertisements. This group spent more than twice as much
time on the main ads as the <em>economic-results</em> group, and even more time
on main ads than the <em>exhaustive group</em>. This observation is incongruent
to <span class="citation">Buscher et al. (<a href="#ref-115">2010</a>)</span>‘s findings, as they observed a generally strong bias <em>against</em>
viewing sponsored links. <span class="citation">Abualsaud &amp; Smucker (<a href="#ref-135">2019</a>)</span> conducted further analysis using these
user types, and, in general, reconfirmed the previous findings. They
found that the results above the fold, especially, <strong><em>the first three
search results are special</em></strong>, more so for economic users. On submitting
a ’weak’ query, if economic users did not find a correct result within
the first three results, they abandoned examination, and reformulated
their query.</p>
<p>Age of searchers also influence SERP evaluation behaviour. <span class="citation">Gossen et al. (<a href="#ref-124">2014</a>)</span>
demonstrated differences in SERP evaluation for children and adults
(Figure <a href="#fig-res-L-serp-user-chars"><strong>??</strong></a>(b)). When answers were not found
within the top search results, the adults reformulated the query
starting a new search, while young users exhaustively explored all the
ten results, and used the navigation buttons between results pages to
continue further examination. Children also paid more attention to
thumbnails and embedded media, and focused less on textual snippets.
Children saw the query suggestions at the bottom of the Google SERP
(because they navigated to the bottom), while the adults did not. <span class="citation">Bilal &amp; Gwizdka (<a href="#ref-139">2016</a>; <a href="#ref-140">Gwizdka &amp; Bilal, 2017</a>)</span> investigated this phenomenon further, and observed that even
within children, age plays a role in SERP evaluation behaviour. Younger
children (grade six, age 11) clicked more often on results in
lower-ranked positions than older children (grade eight, age 13). Older
children’s clicking behaviour was based more often on reading result
snippets, and not just on the ranked position of a result in a SERP.
Whereas, younger children made less deliberate choices in choosing which
result to click, and were more exhaustive in the exploration of results.
Thus, using <span class="citation">Aula et al. (<a href="#ref-102">2005</a>)</span>’s classification and <span class="citation">Dumais et al. (<a href="#ref-117">2010</a>)</span>’s observations, it can be
posited that (younger) children start out as <em>exhaustive</em> searchers.
With increase in age and maturity, older children and adults evolve into
<em>economic</em> searchers. Interestingly, very similar behaviour patterns as
with children (scrolling further down on SERPs, exhaustive exploration,
etc.) were also observed recently for searchers with dyslexia
<span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-palani2020eye">Palani et al., 2020</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>Searcher’s native language also influenced SERP interaction behaviour
<span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-132">Ling et al., 2018</a>)</span> (Figure <a href="#fig-int-L-serp"><strong>??</strong></a>(c)). We discussed in
Section <a href="ch-bg-search.html#sec-bg-search-query">3.2.1</a> that users strongly preferred issuing
queries in a single language, especially their native language. However,
while examining SERPs, they marked search results in both their first
language and second language to be relevant, to an equal degree. This
confirms the usefulness of search result pages that integrate results
from multiple languages. However, a clear separation in the language of
the search results was strongly preferred, and an ‘interleaved’
presentation (e.g. odd numbered results in one language and even
numbered results in another language) was least preferred.</p>

how searchers evaluate search results, or perform <em>relevance judgement</em>.
These criteria were developed based on literature reviews and their
empirical findings from eye-tracking studies. The final list contains 15
relevance criteria (e.g., <em>topicality</em>, <em>quality</em>, <em>recency</em>, <em>scope</em>,
<em>availability</em>, etc.) and can be found in <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-119">Balatsoukas &amp; Ruthven, 2012</a> Appendix B)</span>.</p>
<p>Search engines are increasingly adding different modalities of
information on the SERP, besides the “ten blue links”. These include
images, videos, encyclopaedic information, and maps
(Figure <a href="#fig-int-L-serp-new-vertical"><strong>??</strong></a>). <span class="citation">Z. Liu et al. (<a href="#ref-128">2015</a>)</span> studied the influence of
these different forms of SERP information – called ‘verticals’ – on
searcher’s relevance judgements. A general observation was that if
verticals were present in a SERP, they created strong attraction biases.
The attraction effect was influenced by the type of verticals, while the
vertical quality (relevant or not) did not have a major impact. For
instance, ‘images’ and ‘software download’ verticals had higher visual
attention, while news verticals had equal attention as the “ten blue
links” search results.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>How do users behave when examining a single information-object (e.g., a
a non-search-engine webpage, aka content page) obtained from an IR
system?</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In online information searching, searchers repeatedly interact with
individual webpages, a.k.a. ‘content pages’ in IR terminology. These
webpages can be visited by following links from a search engine,
following links between different webpages, or directly typing the URL
in the browser.</p>
<p>The first group of papers we discuss investigated users’ <strong>visual
attention</strong> and <strong>reading behaviour</strong> on webpages. <span class="citation">Pan et al. (<a href="#ref-pan2004determinants">2004</a>)</span>
studied whether eye-tracking scanpaths on webpages varied based on
task-type, webpage type (business, news, search, or shopping), viewing
order of webpages, and gender of users. The found significant
differences for all factors, except for task-type, which seemed to have
no effect on scanpaths. They used weak task-types: remembering what was
on a webpage vs. no specific task. In a later work on using
informational vs. navigational search-tasks, they again saw limited
effect of task-type on visual attention <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-lorigo2006influence">Lorigo et al., 2006</a>)</span>. Findings
from <span class="citation">Josephson &amp; Holmes (<a href="#ref-josephson2002visual">2002</a>)</span>’s study suggested that users possibly follow
habitually preferred scanpaths on a webpage, which can be influenced by
factors like webpage characteristics and memory. However, they used only
three webpages, making the findings difficult to generalize.
<span class="citation">Goldberg et al. (<a href="#ref-goldberg2002eye">2002</a>)</span> studied eye movements on Web portals during
search-tasks, and saw that header bars were typically not viewed before
focusing the main part of the page. So they suggested placing navigation
bars on the left side of a page. <span class="citation">Beymer et al. (<a href="#ref-beymer2007eye">2007</a>)</span> focused on a very
specific feature on webpages: images that are placed next to text
content and how they influence eye movements during a reading task. They
found significant influence on fixation location and duration. Those
influences were dependent on how the image contents related to the text
contents (i.e., whether they showed ads or text-related images). <span class="citation">Buscher et al. (<a href="#ref-110">2009</a>)</span>
presented findings from a large scale study where users performed
information-foraging and page-recognition tasks. They observed that in
the first few moments, users quickly scanned the top left of the page,
presumably looking for clues about the content, provenance, type of
information, etc. for that page. The elements that were normally
displayed in the upper left third of webpages (e.g., logos, headlines,
titles or perhaps an important picture related to the content) seemed to
be important for recognizing and categorizing a page. After these
initial moments, influence of task-type set in. For page-recognition
tasks, the attention remained in the top-left corner of the webpage.
However, for information-foraging tasks, fixations moved to the
center-left region of the webpage, where the user was possibly trying to
find task-specific information. The right third of webpages attracted
almost no visual attention during the first one-second of each page
view. Afterwards as well, most users seemed to entirely ignore this
region, or only occasionally look at it. This suggested that users had
low expectations of information-content or general relevance on the
right side of most webpages. As many webpages display advertisements on
the right side, this was a plausible observation, and are in line with
the observed “F-shaped-patterns” <a class="footnote-ref" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content='&lt;p&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/f-shaped-pattern-reading-web-content" class="uri"&gt;https://www.nngroup.com/articles/f-shaped-pattern-reading-web-content&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>10</sup></a> on webpages.</p>
<p><span class="citation">Buscher et al. (<a href="#ref-110">2009</a>)</span> also proposed an eye-tracking measure called <em>fixation impact</em>.
This measure first appends a circular Gaussian distribution around each
fixation on a webpage element, to create a fuzzy area of interest. This
is called the <em>distance impact</em> value. If a webpage element completely
covers the fixation circle (Gaussian distribution), it gets a <em>distance
impact</em> value of 1. If the element partially covers the fixation circle,
its <em>distance impact</em> value is smaller. Multiplying the <em>distance
impact</em> value with the fixation duration gives the fixation impact for
the given webpage element. Thus, an element that completely covers the
fixation circle gets the full fixation duration as <em>fixation impact</em>
value. Elements which are partially inside the circle get a value
proportional to the Gaussian distribution. The authors posited that the
rationale behind creating the fixation impact measure was motivated by
observations from human vision research, which indicates that fixation
duration correlates with the amount of visual information processed; the
longer a fixation, the more information is processed around the fixation
centre. Using the fixation impact measure, <span class="citation">Buscher et al. (<a href="#ref-110">2009</a>)</span> proposed a model for
predicting the amount visual attention that individual webpage elements
may receive (i.e. visual salience).</p>
<p>Another group of studies investigated how users judged <strong>relevance of
webpages</strong> w.r.t. an assigned search-task or information need.
<span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-74">Gwizdka, 2018</a>; <a href="#ref-47">Gwizdka &amp; Zhang, 2015a</a>, <a href="#ref-48">2015b</a>)</span> observed that when relevant pages were revisited, the
webpages were read more carefully. Pupil dilations were significantly
larger on visits and revisits to relevant pages, and just before
relevance judgements were made. Certain conditions of visits and
revisits also showed significant differences in EEG alpha frequency band
power, and EEG-derived attention levels. Relevance of individual webpage
elements were also assessed as <em>click-intention</em>: whether users would
click on an element they were looking at. <span class="citation">Slanzi et al. (<a href="#ref-69">2017</a>)</span> used pupillometry and EEG
signals to predict whether a mouse click was present for each eye
fixation. EEG features included simple statistical features of signals
(mean, SD, power, etc.), as well as sophisticated mathematical features
(Hjorth features, Fractal Dimensions, Entropy, etc.). A battery of
classifier models were tested. However, the results were not promising.
Logistic Regression had the highest accuracy (71%), but very low F1
score (0.33), while neural network based classifiers the had highest F1
score (0.4). The authors suspected that the low sampling rate of their
instruments (30 Hz eye-tracker and 128 Hz 14-channel EEG) impacted their
classifier performances. <span class="citation">González-Ibáñez et al. (<a href="#ref-81">2019</a>)</span> compared relevance prediction performances
in the presence and absence of eye-tracking data, and argued that when
eye-tracking data collection is not feasible, mouse left-clicks can be
used a good alternative indicator of relevance.</p>
<p>The ‘<em>Competition for Attention</em>’ theory states that items in our visual
field compete for our attention <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-desimone1995neural">Desimone &amp; Duncan, 1995</a>)</span>. <span class="citation">Djamasbi et al. (<a href="#ref-30">2013</a>)</span> studied web
search and browsing from the perspective of this theory. Theoretical
models suggest that in goal-directed searches, information-salience
and/or information-relevance drives search behaviour (i.e. competition
for attention does not hold true), whereas exploratory search behaviour
is influenced by competition among stimuli that attracts a user’s
attention (i.e. competition for attention holds true). However, in
practice, information search behaviour often becomes a combination of
both types of visual search activities <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-groner1984looking">Groner et al., 1984</a>)</span>. <span class="citation">Djamasbi et al. (<a href="#ref-30">2013</a>)</span> found
that, despite the goal directed nature of their search-task (finding the
best snack place in Boston to take their friends) <em>competition for
attention</em> had some effect at the content page level. Some of the users’
attention was diverted to non-focal areas on content pages. However,
there was little effect of <em>competition for attention</em> on how the
results were viewed on SERPs. Users exhibited the familiar top-to-bottom
pattern of viewing
(Section <a href="ch-bg-search.html#sec-bg-search-list">3.2.2</a>), paying the most attention to the top
two entries.</p>

<p>Our focus of discussion in this proposal is information searching and
learning. As we saw in Chapter <a href="ch-bg-learn.html#ch-bg-learn">2</a>, learning and expertise are closely connected:
expertise is an evolving characteristic of users that reflects learning
over time, rather than being a static property
<span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-rieh2016searching">Rieh et al., 2016</a>; <a href="#ref-sawyer2005cambridge">Sawyer, 2005</a>)</span>. <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-white2016interactions">White, 2016a, Chapter 7</a>)</span> considers three types of expertise, that are relevant in
information seeking settings: <em>(i)</em> domain or subject-matter expertise;
<em>(ii)</em> search expertise; and <em>(iii)</em> task expertise. <strong>Domain or
subject-matter expertise</strong> describes people’s knowledge in a specialised
subject area such as a domain of interest. <strong>Search expertise</strong> refers
to people’s skill level at performing information-seeking activities,
both in a Web search setting and in other settings such as specialised
domains. <strong>Task expertise</strong> describes people’s expertise in performing
particular search tasks, potentially independent of domain. Although
considered distinctly, the boundaries between these expertise types are

<p>As a stark contrast, <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-zlatkin2021students">Zlatkin-Troitschanskaia et al., 2021</a>)</span> reviewed literature on
higher education <strong>students’ information search behaviour</strong>. Students
can be considered as novices in all three respects:
domain/subject-matter, search skills, and task. The authors report that
across literature, higher education students’ information search
behaviour tends to follow some general general patterns: <em>(i) foraging:</em>
no explicit (task-specific) research plan and little understanding of
the differences (pros/cons) between various IR systems; <em>(ii) Google
dependence:</em> no intention to use any search tool other than Google,
causing students to struggle to understand library information
structures and engage with scholarly literature effectively; <em>(iii)
rudimentary search heuristic:</em> reliance on one and the same simple
search strategy, regardless of search context; <em>(iv) habitual topic
changing:</em> students change the search topic after rather superficial
skimming, and before evaluating all search results; and <em>(v) overuse of
natural language:</em> students type questions into the search box that are
phrased as if posing them to a person. Highly ranked online sources
accessed via a well-known search engine were perceived as trustworthy.</p>
<p>Effects of memory span and working memory capacity have also been found
to influence search effort and search behaviour

systems (higher effort invested in searching library database vs. web)
were found by <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-rieh2012amount">Rieh et al., 2012</a>)</span>. A couple of studies showed that mental

<span class="header-section-number">3.4</span> Assessing Learning during Search<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#assessing-learning-during-search"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h2>
<p>In order for IR systems to foster user-learning at scale, while
respecting individual differences of searchers, there is a need for
measures to represent, assess, and evaluate the learning process,
possibly in an automated fashion. Consequently, a variety of assessment
tools have been used in prior studies. These include self reports, close
ended factual questions (multiple choice), open ended questions (short
answers, summaries, essays, free recall, sentence generation), and
visual mapping techniques using concept maps or mind maps. Each approach
has its own associated advantages and limitations. <strong>Self-report</strong> asks
searchers to rate their self-perceived pre-search and post-search
knowledge levels <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-ghosh2018SearchingLearningExploring">Ghosh et al., 2018</a>; <a href="#ref-o2020role">O’Brien et al., 2020</a>)</span>.
This approach is the easiest to construct, and can be generalised over
any search topic. However, self-perceptions may not objectively
represent true learning. <strong>Closed ended questions</strong> test searchers’
knowledge using factual multiple choice questions (MCQs). The answer
options can be a mixture of fact-based responses (<em>TRUE</em>, <em>FALSE</em>, or <em>I
DON’T KNOW</em>),
<span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-gadiraju2018AnalyzingKnowledgeGain">Gadiraju et al., 2018</a>; <a href="#ref-xu2020does">Xu et al., 2020</a>; <a href="#ref-yu2018PredictingUserKnowledgea">Yu et al., 2018</a>)</span>
or recall-based responses (<em>I remember / don’t remember seeing this
information</em>) <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-kruikemeier2018learning">Kruikemeier et al., 2018</a>; <a href="#ref-roy2020exploring">Roy et al., 2020</a>)</span>.
Constructing topic-dependant MCQs may take time and effort, since they
are topic dependant. Recent work on automatic question generation may be
leveraged to overcome this limitation <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-syed2020improving">Syed et al., 2020</a>)</span>. Evaluating
close ended questions is the easiest, and generally automated in various
online learning platforms. Multiple choice questions, however, suffer
from a limitation: they allow respondents to answer correctly by
guesswork. <strong>Open ended questions</strong> assess learning by letting searchers
write natural language summaries or short answers
<span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-bhattacharya2018relating">Bhattacharya &amp; Gwizdka, 2018</a>; <a href="#ref-o2020role">O’Brien et al., 2020</a>; <a href="#ref-roy2021note">Roy et al., 2021</a>)</span>. Depending on
experimental design, prompts for writing such responses can be generic
(least effort) <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-bhattacharya2018relating">Bhattacharya &amp; Gwizdka, 2018</a>, <a href="#ref-bhattacharya2019measuring">2019b</a>)</span>,
or topic-specific (some effort) <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-syed2020improving">Syed et al., 2020</a>)</span>. While this
approach can provide the richest information about the searcher’s
knowledge state, evaluating such responses is the most challenging, and
requires extensive human intervention

discussed in Section <a href="ch-bg-learn.html#sec-bg-learn-artefact">2.4.2</a>). <strong>Visual mapping</strong> techniques such

Concept maps have been discussed at length in Section <a href="ch-bg-learn.html#sec-bg-concept-maps">2.3.1</a>. Learning has also been measured in

<p>Learning is a longitudinal process, occurring gradually over time
(Sections <a href="ch-bg-learn.html#sec-bg-learn-sensemaking">2.3</a> and <a href="ch-bg-learn.html#sec-bg-learn-principles">2.2</a>). Therefore, information
researchers have studied participant’s search behaviour in prior,
<strong>albeit few</strong>, longitudinal studies. Examples include studies by
<span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-kelly2006measuring-a">Kelly, 2006a</a>, <a href="#ref-kelly2006measuring-b">2006b</a>; <a href="#ref-kuhlthau2004seeking">Kuhlthau, 2004</a>; <a href="#ref-vakkari2001changes">Vakkari, 2001a</a>; <a href="#ref-white2009characterizing">White et al., 2009</a>; <a href="#ref-wildemuth2004effects">Wildemuth, 2004</a>)</span>.</p>
<p><span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-wildemuth2004effects">Wildemuth, 2004</a>)</span> examined the search behaviour of medical
students in microbiology. In this experiment, students were observed at
three points of time (at the beginning of the course, at the end of the
course, and six months after the course), under the assumption that
domain expertise changes during a semester. Some search strategies, most
notably the gradual narrowing of the results through iterative query
modification, were the same throughout the observation period. Other
strategies varied over time as individuals gained domains knowledge.
Novices were less efficient in selecting concepts to include in search
and less accurate in their tactics for modifying searches.
<span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-pennanen2003students">Pennanen &amp; Vakkari, 2003</a>; <a href="#ref-vakkari2000cognition">Vakkari, 2000</a>, <a href="#ref-vakkari2001changes">2001a</a>, <a href="#ref-vakkari2001theory">2001b</a>)</span>
also examined students at multiple points in time, as they were
developing their thesis proposal. One important change in behaviour was
the use of a more varied and more specific vocabulary as students
learned more about their research topic. <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-weber2019informationseeking">Weber et al., 2019</a>)</span>
examined a large sample of German students from all academic fields in a
two wave study and found that the more advanced they are in their
studies, the more students show a more advanced search behaviour (e.g.,
using more English queries and accessing academic databases more
frequently). <strong>Advanced search behaviour predicted better university
grades.</strong> <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-weber2018can">Weber et al., 2018</a>)</span> also provide mixed evidence on the potential
long-term effects of such interventions, as some of their participants
reverted to their previous habits two weeks after the study and
therefore exhibited only short-term changes in their information-seeking
behaviour.</p>
<p>Overall, results regarding the promotion of user’ search and evaluation
skills are encouraging. But there is a clear need for more longitudinal
studies. The general body of search-as-learning literature examines the
learner in the short-term, typically over the course of a single lab
session <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-kelly2009evaluation">Kelly et al., 2009</a>; <a href="#ref-zlatkin2021students">Zlatkin-Troitschanskaia et al., 2021</a>)</span>. The trend is
similar in other Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) research venues. A
meta-analysis of 1014 user studies reported in the ACM CHI 2020
conference revealed that more than 85% of the studies observed
participants for a day or less. To this day, “longitudinal studies are
the exception rather than the norm” <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-koeman2020hciux">Koeman, 2020</a>)</span>. “An
over-reliance on short studies risks inaccurate findings, potentially
resulting in prematurely embracing or disregarding new concepts”

<p>As we saw in Section <a href="ch-bg-learn.html#sec-bg-learn-sensemaking">2.3</a>, learning <em>is</em> sensemaking. Yet,
modern search systems are still quite far from supporting sensemaking
and learning, and rather, at best are good <em>locators</em> of information.
<span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-rieh2016searching">Rieh et al., 2016</a>)</span> says that modern search systems should support
sensemaking by offering more interactive functions, such as tagging for
annotation, or tracking individuals’ search history, so that a learner
could return to a particular learning point. In addition, a system could
provide new features that allow learners to reflect upon their own
learning process and search outcomes, thus facilitating the development
of critical thinking skills.</p>

<p><em>It’s easy to be impressed by the scientific and engineering feats that have produced web search engines. They are, unquestionably, one of the most impactful and disruptive information technologies of our time. However, it’s critical to remember their many limitations: they do not help us <strong>know what we want to know</strong>; they do not help us <strong>choose the right words</strong> to find it; they do not help us know if what we’ve found is <strong>relevant or true</strong>; and they do not help us <strong>make sense of it</strong>. All they do is quickly retrieve what other people on the internet have shared. While this is a great feat, all of the content on the internet is far from everything we know, and quite often a poor substitute for expertise.</em></p>

</h2>
<p>In this second chapter of the background literature review, we discussed
<em>(i)</em> how searchers interact with three stages / interfaces of modern
information retrieval system: query formulation, search results
evaluation, and content page evaluation; <em>(ii)</em> how expertise and
working memory influence overall search behaviour; <em>(iii)</em> how learning
or knowledge gain during search has been assessed in recent search as
learning literature; and <em>(iv)</em> what are the limitations of current
search systems to foster learning, including gaps in literature about
long term search behaviour and learning outcomes, as well as lack of
support for sensemaking.</p>
<p>We saw that while we have a plethora of studies investigating search
behaviour searchers in the short term, we have merely a handful of
studies observing the same participant for more than a day. To the best
of the author’s knowledge, most of these studies were conducted over a
decade ago. Thus, while we have excellent knowledge of short term nature
of influence of searching on learning, we do not know what are the
longer term effects. Furthermore, we we have gaps in our knowledge of
<em>(i)</em> how practices like articulation and externalization, and user
attributes like metacognition, motivation, and self regulation moderate
the searching as learning process; <em>(ii)</em> how these moderator variables
change over time; and <em>(iii)</em> what these phenomena collectively entail
for the design of future learning-centric IR systems. In the next
chapter, we take these gaps in knowledge and use them to inform our
research questions and hypotheses.</p>
