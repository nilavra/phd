<p>In this dissertation, an exploratory longitudinal study was conducted to investigate how students’ longitudinal information search behaviours change with time, what role individual differences play in this process, and how it affects their learning and search outcomes.
The study consisted of three phases, with the main longitudinal tracking phase observing students search behaviour as they worked on a research paper final project for a class.</p>
<p>The findings from the study suggest that metacognition, motivation, and self-regulation are important factors that determine, direct, and sustain what students do to search and learn.
Students with high levels of these traits demonstrated higher perceived-learning and search outcomes, compared to those with low levels of these traits.
Additionally, the high group demonstrated more stable information searching behaviour over time compared to the low group.</p>
<p>As depicted in the opening quote from <span class="citation">Stebbins (<a href="#ref-stebbins2001exploratory">2001</a>)</span>, our exploratory research was inductive, aiming to illuminate new concepts through observation.
We purposefully did not follow a deductive approach, which usually proves or tests an existing theory or hypothesis.
This resulted in very few statistically significant results in our findings.
However, we were more interested in discovering interesting patterns, and leave the task of confirmatory, deductive investigation to follow-up studies.</p>
<!-- We believe the findings from this study will lead to more confirmatory studies. -->
<!-- Overall, the findings suggest that developing effective search strategies and building confidence in one's knowledge on a given topic can lead to higher perceived learning and search outcomes. However, there may be other factors that come into play when it comes to achieving higher grades in research paper assignments. -->
<!-- 

Most of the results did not have statistical significance - but that's okay because this is exploratory research, which is inductive, rather than deductive.

We were more interested in discovering interesting patterns.
We believe the findings from this study will lead to more confirmatory studies.

<p>Apart from the findings discussed at length in previous chapters, the LongSAL study also advances the field of Interactive IR in several aspects.</p>
<p>First, while the initial sample size may appear small with only 16 participants, it is important to consider the extensive amount of search log data collected from each participant over the course of the semester. This accumulation of data translates to a substantial amount of time spent on information searching, providing a robust foundation for drawing meaningful conclusions.
<!-- Specifically, you mentioned that each participant recorded multiple hours of search sessions throughout the research paper writing process.  -->
Considering that we collected and analysed more than 1500 minutes, equivalent to over 26 hours of search log data, it becomes evident that our study has amassed a substantial quantity of information. This large amount of data allows for a comprehensive examination of participants’ information-searching behaviours, their evolution over time, and their relationship with individual differences in motivation, metacognition, and self-regulation.
By collecting such a significant volume of data, the LongSAL study possesses a strong empirical basis for reasonable and reliable findings. It provides a rich and detailed understanding of how undergraduate students engage in information searching while writing a research paper. This extensive breadth and depth of data collected bolsters the credibility and robustness of the findings, within the context of our study population.</p>
<p>Second, the fact that the student participants in the study were from one class is another important contribution. Previous works often examined search tasks from different classes or disciplines, which may introduce variability and make it difficult to isolate the specific effects of motivation, metacognition, and self-regulation on information-searching behaviours and learning outcomes.
By focusing on a single class and a specific research paper writing task, the LongSAL study provides a more controlled and focused approach to understanding the relationship between these factors.
This allows for a deeper exploration of how individual differences in motivation, metacognition, and self-regulation influence information-searching behaviours and learning outcomes within a consistent context.
Additionally, studying participants from one class offers the advantage of a shared learning environment and potentially similar prior knowledge and skill levels. This helps to minimize confounding variables and enhance the internal validity of our findings.
This emphasizes the unique aspect of our study and provides valuable insights into the specific dynamics of information-searching behaviours and learning outcomes within a particular educational context.</p>
<!-- First, although at initial glance the sample size may appear to be a mere N=10, since each participants recorded multiple hours of search sessions over the semester, we collected and analysed more than 1500 minutes, or over 26 hours of search log data. 
This quantity is quite significant to draw reasonable conclusions. -->
<p><span style=" color: red;">——– nbrevision002 ——–</span></p>
<p>This dissertation also has some methodological contributions.
The first is to relate individual differences in motivation, metacognition, and self-regulation differences in a combined, holistic format with information search behaviour.
This was achieved through the person-centred approach of Latent Profile Analysis.
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study in information science and IIR literature to have employed Latent Profile Analysis in such a manner.</p>
<p>Our second methodological contribution is the development of the YASBIL browsing logger <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-bhattacharya2021yasbil">Bhattacharya &amp; Gwizdka, 2021</a>)</span>, which was developed primarily as a response to the COVID-19 pandemic.
<!-- With the onset of the pandemic, there was a staggering halt in in-lab human subjects research, and we had to plan for an alternative strategy to carry out IIR research.  -->
<!-- YASBIL was the fruit of that labour. -->
As human subjects research in labs came to a halt, we had to find an alternative approach to carry out IIR research.
The YASBIL logger was developed to enable us to collect data on students’ online browsing behaviour as they searched for information. This tool allowed us to track students’ search behaviour and analyse it in detail, providing insights into how they engage with information sources, evaluate information, and how their information search behaviour evolves over time.</p>
<p>Third, the URL-based classification system (Section <a href="data-analysis-results-and-discussion-longitudinal-tracking-phase.html#sec-res-url-categorization">6.6</a>) provided a useful way to categorize webpages based on their type, allowing us to gain insights into how users’ search behaviour varies across different types of webpages. By analysing the patterns of webpage types visited by users during their information search process, we were able to identify which types of webpages were most commonly visited and how they related to users’ search behaviour. This information can be used to improve the design of information systems and search engines, as well as to inform the development of tailored interventions that support users’ information search needs.</p>
<p>Together, these methodological contributions offer new ways of understanding the complex relationships between individual differences in motivation, metacognition, and self-regulation, and how they impact information search behaviour and learning outcomes. Additionally, the YASBIL browsing logger provides a powerful tool for researchers to gather detailed information about students’ online browsing behaviour, making it possible to track their search behaviour and analyse it in detail. These contributions provide valuable resources for future researchers in the field of Information Science and Information Retrieval, and offer insights into how we can design more effective searching as learning environments.</p>

<h2>
<span class="header-section-number">9.3</span> Limitations<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#limitations"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h2>
<p>Like any other scientific endeavour, the LongSAL study came with its limitations.</p>
<p>The most prominent <strong>theoretical limitation</strong> of the study was the choice of learning outcomes.
Although we discuss at length about the inefficacy of traditional learning outcome measures in Chapter <a href="ch-bg-learn.html#ch-bg-learn">2</a>, we were involuntarily forced to use two of them in this study – self-perceived learning outcomes, and instructor assigned grades.
Our initial plan was to use Concept Maps for assessing qualitative and quantitative changes in students’ learning and knowledge of concepts.
But we were limited by technology, and had to settle for self-ratings.
Education Scientists are repeatedly calling for better assessment strategies for learning <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-cope2017elearningc">Cope &amp; Kalantzis, 2017</a>; <a href="#ref-urgo2022learning">Urgo &amp; Arguello, 2022</a>)</span>.
Future researchers in search-as-learning must work hand in hand with educators and education researchers to investigate and apply more sophisticated forms of learning assessments, that are more equitable in the face of learner diversity.</p>
<p>In terms of <strong>technical limitations</strong>, there were a handful.
First, due to the nature of current web-technologies, we could not determine when participants were reading a PDF file on their browser.
Browser level JavaScript works only on webpages, and that is what YASBIL used to log user behaviour.
If a participant downloaded a bunch of PDFs at a given time, and read them later offline, even when turning YASBIL on, YASBIL would be blind to such readings.
Second, we could not analyze clicks on content pages. This is due to an abundance of advertisements and cookie preference popups that any user first has to encounter, before even beginning to settle on the content. This is often quite an annoyance, and also taints the dwell time measure on webpages.
Last but not the least, the low sample size is always a limitation.
We had initial hopes of recruiting about 30-40 participants for the study.
However, despite our best efforts, only 18 signed up, 16 remained till the middle of the semester, and 10 completed the entire study.
Previous literature also shows that past longitudinal studies had similar low sample sizes.
For instance, <span class="citation">Kuhlthau (<a href="#ref-kuhlthau2004seeking">2004</a>)</span> had 20 participants, <span class="citation">Vakkari (<a href="#ref-vakkari2001changes">2001a</a>)</span> had 11 and <span class="citation">Kelly (<a href="#ref-kelly2006measuringa">2006a</a>)</span> had 7 participants.</p>
<!-- 

### Technical Limitation

- No PDF
- N=16 to N=10
- Also check anticipated limitations section from proposal
- Did not assess goodness of fit of whether first order Markov chain is the most appropriate for modelling search tactic transitions (Besag and Mondal’s (2013) statistical test)
- did not track revisits across different tasks
- clicks may have been on popup ads, cookie consent forms, and others, instead of only links (difficult to guesstimate from HTML markup)

Some difficulties:

- opening same URL in 2 different tabs and switching between them for a while before realising one is different from the other
  - or maybe long webpage (e.g.) book - two tabs at two different locations in webpage

<p>In conclusion, this dissertation has explored the role of motivation, metacognition and self-regulation in shaping the information search behaviours and learning outcomes of students.
The findings demonstrate that differences in these individual traits are crucial components of successful searching as learning behaviour.
As <span class="citation">Winne &amp; Azevedo (<a href="#ref-winne2022metacognition">2022</a>)</span> argues, metacognition is the engine of self-regulated learning.
To help learners develop and apply productive self-regulated learning, search as learning environments should be designed to foster effective use of metacognitive strategies.
Learning technologies should be used to induce, track, model, and support learners’ metacognition across tasks, domains, and contexts.
As motivation and metacognition are closely intertwined in complex ways, understanding their relationships is the key to designing the next paradigm of searching as learning systems.</p>

This dissertation study aimed to investigate the role of metacognition in information searching as a learning activity. 

The study consisted of three phases. The first phase was an exploratory study that investigated the relationship between metacognition and information searching. The second phase was a longitudinal study that examined the impact of changing individual differences on students' longitudinal information searching behaviors and learning outcomes. The third phase was a study that compared the information searching behaviors of students on repeated and non-repeated search tasks.

The findings of the exploratory study indicated that metacognition is a crucial component of information searching as a learning activity. The results showed that the use of metacognitive strategies such as monitoring and control positively influenced the effectiveness of information searching. The results of the longitudinal study showed that 

The third phase of the study found that the information searching behaviors of students differed on repeated and non-repeated search tasks. The findings indicated that on non-repeated search tasks, students engaged in more exploratory behavior and exhibited higher levels of transition entropy in their search tactics. On repeated search tasks, students demonstrated more stable search behaviors, and their search tactics showed lower levels of entropy.

The study concludes that metacognition plays a crucial role in information searching as a learning activity. 

From @winne2022metacognition:

Learning is shaped by metacognitive knowledge exercised through metacognitive monitoring and metacognitive control.
Metacognition is the engine of self-regulated learning. To help learners develop and apply
productive self-regulated learning, learning environments should be designed to foster effective use of metacognitive strategies.
Learning technologies can be used to induce, track, model, and support learners’ metacognition across tasks, domains, and contexts.
Motivation and metacognition are closely intertwined in complex ways. Understanding their relationships is key to designing effective searching as learning environments.

and must be taken into account when designing effective searching as learning environments.
If effective use of metacognitive strategies can be fostered through well-designed learning environments,

Moreover, the study highlights the potential of learning technologies in supporting learners' metacognition across a variety of tasks, domains, and contexts. As this research has shown, 

Overall, this dissertation provides valuable insights into the ways in which metacognition and self-regulated learning can be leveraged to enhance learning outcomes and information search behaviors. By using these insights to inform the design of effective learning environments, we can help learners develop and apply productive SRL strategies, and ultimately achieve their full learning potential.

## Research Summary

By using Latent Profile Analysis to group participants based on their self-reported scores on motivation, metacognition, and self-regulation, we were able to identify distinct subgroups within the sample. This can help us to better understand how individual differences in these factors might relate to information searching behaviors and learning outcomes.

Using a longitudinal design with with stages of writing (proposal, outline, rough draft, and final paper) also allows us to examine how these factors and behaviors might change over time and how they might relate to each other at different stages of the writing process.

Overall, the study has the potential to provide valuable insights into the complex interplay between individual differences, information searching behaviors, and learning outcomes in the context of research paper writing.

QRTs
Overall, these findings suggest that effective query reformulation strategies may be an important factor in achieving better self-perceived learning and search outcomes among undergraduate students writing research papers. Future research could explore the specific techniques and strategies that are most effective in promoting effective query reformulation among undergraduate students.

Phase 2 I:
The differences in information behaviors observed between the high and low groups in your study can be explained by a number of factors. One possible factor is motivation: the high group may have been more motivated to conduct a thorough and comprehensive search for information, which led them to explore a wider range of topics and use a variety of sources. The low group, on the other hand, may have been less motivated, and may have focused more narrowly on specific topics or sources.

Another factor is self-regulation: the high group may have been better at managing their time and resources, which allowed them to engage with a wider range of sources and explore a broader range of topics. The low group may have struggled with time management or resource allocation, which led them to rely more heavily on a smaller set of sources or topics.

Metacognition may also have played a role: the high group may have had a better understanding of their own strengths and weaknesses as information seekers, and may have adjusted their search strategies accordingly. The low group may have had a less developed sense of metacognition, which led them to rely on familiar strategies or sources, even if those strategies or sources were not always the most effective.

Finally, memory span may have been a factor: the high group may have had a larger working memory capacity, which allowed them to process more information and make connections between different sources or topics. The low group may have had a smaller working memory capacity, which made it more difficult for them to integrate information from multiple sources or to switch between different topics or sources.

Overall, these factors likely interacted in complex ways to produce the observed differences in information behaviors between the two groups. By identifying these factors and their effects on information seeking behaviors, your study provides valuable insights into how students approach research and how their behaviors may affect their learning outcomes.

Additionally, LPA can identify subgroups of individuals who may be at risk for negative outcomes, such as poor task performance, low job satisfaction, or developmental delays. This information can be used to design targeted interventions that are tailored to the specific needs of these subgroups.

In summary, LPA is a powerful and flexible person-centered statistical approach that is increasingly used in organizational psychology and child development research. Its ability to identify and describe latent subgroups within a population provides a more nuanced understanding of human behavior, and its applications have the potential to inform the design of targeted interventions that can improve outcomes for individuals and organizations.

In the context of information search behavior, LPA can be used to investigate how search behavior varies across different contexts or populations. For example, researchers may use LPA to identify different search patterns among novice versus expert users, or among different age or cultural groups. This can help to inform the design of search interfaces and other information systems that are tailored to the needs of specific user groups.

Overall, LPA is an interesting and valuable technique for understanding information search behavior because it allows researchers to move beyond simple group comparisons and identify meaningful subgroups within a population. By uncovering these subgroups, researchers can gain deeper insights into the complex and nuanced ways that people search for information online, and use this knowledge to improve the design and effectiveness of information systems.

Overall, the use of LPA to classify participants into high and low groups based on their scores on the IMI, MAI, and SRQ was an effective method for identifying individual differences in motivation, metacognition, and self-regulation. This allowed us to examine the relationship between these individual differences and search behavior, which is the focus of this study.

### Entropy
Transition analysis and entropy are powerful tools in the field of information retrieval that can help to uncover patterns in user search behaviour across disparate tasks and activities. By analysing transitions between different states, such as between queries, documents, or web pages, transition analysis can reveal important insights into how users navigate information spaces and interact with search systems. For example, it can be used to identify common search patterns or to identify areas where users may be experiencing difficulty or confusion.

Entropy, on the other hand, provides a quantitative measure of the uncertainty or randomness in user search behaviour. By calculating entropy values for different aspects of search behaviour, such as query reformulation or click-through behaviour, researchers can gain a better understanding of the structure and characteristics of user search behaviour in different contexts. This can help to identify areas for improvement in search systems and to design more effective search algorithms and interfaces.

Together, transition analysis and entropy provide a powerful framework for understanding user search behaviour and improving the design and effectiveness of search systems. By analysing transitions and quantifying the level of uncertainty in user behaviour, researchers can uncover valuable insights that can inform the development of more effective search systems and improve the overall user experience.

This chapter aims to revisit the research questions that guided the study in light of the findings from the analysis. The chapter presents a discussion of the implications of the findings for the research questions and provides recommendations for future research.

Conclusion for Revisiting Research Questions in Light of Results:
The findings from the analysis shed light on how individual differences, task goals, and repeated engagement with search tasks affect information search behaviors and learning outcomes. The chapter provides a summary of the key findings and discusses their implications for future research in information science and information retrieval.

Introduction for Conclusion:
This chapter presents a summary of the study's main findings, implications, and limitations. The chapter also provides recommendations for practitioners and researchers in information science and information retrieval.

Conclusion for Conclusion:
The study aimed to investigate the effects of individual differences, task goals, and repeated engagement with search tasks on information search behaviors and learning outcomes. The findings suggest that repeated engagement with search tasks can improve information search behaviors and learning outcomes. The study also highlights the importance of considering individual differences and task goals when designing search tasks for educational purposes. The chapter concludes by discussing the limitations of the study and providing recommendations for future research.
