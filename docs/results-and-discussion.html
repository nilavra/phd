<p>Additionally we also report Common Language Effect Size (CLES) for each statistical test result.
The common language effect size is the proportion of pairs where <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> is higher than <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>.
In other words, it is the probability that a score sampled at random from one distribution will be greater than a score sampled from some other distribution.
CLES was first introduced by McGraw and Wong (1992) [TODO]. The Python statistical library employed in data analysis – Pingouin <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-vallat2018pingouin">Vallat, 2018</a>)</span> – uses a brute-force version of the formula given by Vargha and Delaney 2000 [TODO]:
The advantage is of this method are twofold. First, the brute-force approach pairs each observation of x to its y counterpart, and therefore does not require normally distributed data. Second, the formula takes ties into account and therefore works with ordinal data.</p>
<p>In the interest of better presentation and readability of this chapter, some of the ancillary plots are presented in Appendices <a href="app-plots-query.html#app-plots-query">D</a> and <a href="app-plots-search.html#app-plots-search">E</a>.</p>

<p>Query length was operationalized as the number of terms (words separated by spaces) in the search query that participants submitted to the search engines or other information retrieval sites.
Query length can vary from a single word to several phrases or a full sentence.
<!-- Search engines use algorithms to analyze search query length and interpret the intent of the user's search in order to provide the most relevant search results.  -->
Longer search queries may indicate a more specific or complex information need, while shorter search queries may be more general or broad in scope.
<!-- The number of terms in each query was aggregated over each participant-task pair, to obtain total, average, and standard deviation (variability) of query length. --></p>
<p>For all tasks, on average, the high group issued longer queries than the low group (Figure ResP4090733126835336320), except before the Outline (<code>PHASE2B</code>), and the Final Paper submission (<code>PHASE2D</code>).
The low group, with lower levels of motivation, metacognition, and self-regulation, were issuring queries which were often two terms (words) shorter on average, than the corresponding queries from the high group.</p>
<p>The total query length for the low group increased monotonically over the semester during <code>PHASE2</code> (Figure ResP494716060171793945), with the longest queries being issued by this group before the Final Paper submission phase (<code>PHASE2D</code>).
On the other hand, queries from the high group were the longest during the Outline phase (<code>PHASE2B</code>), and then it decreased in the subsequent phases.
This indicates that the high group, with higher levels of motivation, metacognition, and self-regulation, were planning ahead in the early parts of the semester to find their references.
On the other hand, the low group, with lower levels of those traits, demonstrated a tendency to procrastinate and delay their work until the final paper.
A quote from participant <code>P006_HANOI</code> illustrates this phenomenon:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“so far for this rough draft I haven’t actually had to google anything since I downloaded everything into pdfs during the outline stage and haven’t needed any new material so far.”</em></p>
<div style="text-align:right">

<!-- 
LO group had highest total query length before final paper (ResN5894660104957913932)

</h3>
<p>Count of queries per search task refers to the number of separate queries or search attempts that a participant issued in order to complete a task.
<!-- having the same information need. -->
<!-- single information-seeking task on a search engine or other information retrieval system. A search task is typically defined as a specific information need or question that the user is attempting to answer through a series of search queries.  -->
The count of queries per search task may vary depending on the complexity of the information need, the user’s level of expertise with the search system, and other factors.
<!-- This metric is commonly used in information retrieval research to evaluate the effectiveness of search systems and user search behavior. --></p>
<p>The average number of queries issued by the high group increased from Proposal to Outline to Rough Draft, and then decreased before the Final Paper task (Figure ResP4526976288600811998).
In contrast, the low group issued higher number of queries during the early part of the semester – Proposal and Outline – but then they issued lower number of queries during the later parts of the semester, w.r.t. the high group.
The difference in the total number of queries issued by the two groups approched statistical significance according to a two-tailed Mann-Whitney U test, but the effect size was very weak <span class="math inline">\((U = 14.0, n_{low}=8, n_{high}=8, p=.06, CLES=0.22)\)</span>.</p>

<p>Query reformulation refers to the process of modifying or refining a search query in order to improve the relevance of search results and better match the user’s information needs (Section <a href="ch-bg-search.html#sec-bg-search-query">3.2.1</a>).
Query reformulation typically occurs due to a searcher’s improved understanding of how to better translate their information need into a search query.
Using the taxonomy proposed by <span class="citation">C. Liu et al. (<a href="#ref-liu2010analysis">2010</a>)</span> (Figure <a href="ch-bg-search.html#fig:res-Q-QRT-txnmy">3.3</a>), we classified each previous-next query pair issued by participants into one of the five query reformulation types (QRTs):
New,
Generalization,
Specialization,
Word Substitution,
and
Repeat.</p>
<!-- When a user submits a search query that does not return satisfactory results, they may attempt to reformulate their query by using different keywords, rephrasing their question, or adding or removing search terms. Query reformulation can be done manually by the user or automatically by the search system using techniques such as query expansion or query suggestion. The goal of query reformulation is to help users find the information they are looking for more efficiently and effectively. -->
<p>The low group issued more number of <strong>New</strong> queries in total (Figure ResN3873804091287075248) and on average (Figure ResP3026382842695489517), compared to the high group.
During the Rough Draft and Final Paper phases, the low group exhibited heightened tendency to generate New search queries in their pursuit of novel information.
On average, participants in the low group issued four more search queries than those in the HI group in these last two phases of the research project (Figure ResP3026382842695489517).
This suggests that the LO group engaged in more active and extensive information-seeking behaviour, potentially reflecting a greater sense of urgency and pressure to complete their assignments.
The difference in total number of New queries between the groups approached significance <span class="math inline">\((U = 50.0, n_{low}=8, n_{high}=8, p=.06, CLES=0.78)\)</span>, with a moderately strong effect size.</p>
<!-- ResN8316003849035045794 
no. of new queries was the highest during final paper for the LO group
they were frantically searching for new information
on an average, each participant in the LO group was making 4 more search queries than those in the HI group during the final paper phase. -->
<p>The low group demonstrated a significantly higher count of total <strong>Query Generalizations</strong> <span class="math inline">\((U = 44.5, n_{low}=7, n_{high}=7, p=.01, CLES=0.91)\)</span>.
While the high group issued a total of <span class="math inline">\(2.57 \pm 2.1\)</span> query generalizations per task the low group were issuing <span class="math inline">\(9.86 \pm 6.7\)</span> generalized queries for the same, across the entire study (Figure ResN3302769723271690264).
Query generalization is an indicative of exploratory behaviour, and this increase by the low group indicates a lack of specificity in the participants’ information needs, which may lead to lower precision in search results.</p>
<p>The high group issued an average at least one word substitution for each search task.
The trend in the count of total <strong>Query Specializations</strong> was similar to that of Query Generalizations (Figure ResN6450294753032251158).
The high group demonstrated the maximum number of query specialization before the Outline phase, whereas the low group did the same before the Final Paper phase.
While the difference was not significant, the effect size was moderately high <span class="math inline">\((U = 42.5, n_{low}=8, n_{high}=7, p=.10, CLES=0.76)\)</span>.</p>
<p><strong>Word Substitutions</strong> were performed in all the tasks by the high group, whereas the low group skipped it during Proposal, and the <code>PHASE3-BIAS</code> task (Figure ResN3108315939720148502).</p>
<p>We faced a challenge in disentangling <strong>Repeat</strong> queries from “hub-and-spoke” behaviour, where the user goes back and forth between the SERP and a content page by using the browser’s forward and back buttons <a class="footnote-ref" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="&lt;p&gt;The SERP is the hub, which represents the initial point of inquiry, while the spokes represent the subsequent branches of exploration along different content pages. This search behaviour is often used when users have a general idea of the topic they are interested in, but need to explore different facets of the topic to narrow down their search and find relevant information.&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>15</sup></a>.
Each back button press on the browser (to go back to the SERP from a content page) meant a fresh HTTP GET request was sent to the search engine.
This resulted in YASBIL logging the move as a resubmission of the query.
Keeping this in mind, we observed that the low group issued a significantly higher number of repeat queries (or hub-and-spoke moves), compared to the high group <span class="math inline">\((U = 51.5, n_{low}=7, n_{high}=8, p=.0077, CLES=0.92)\)</span>.
The highest differences occurred in the Outline phase and the Final paper phase (Figure ResP7955607431899741484), with the low group issuing double the number of repeat queries <span class="math inline">\((6.11 \pm 3.7)\)</span> on average, w.r.t. the high group <span class="math inline">\((3.51 \pm 2.8)\)</span></p>

<span class="header-section-number">7.2.5</span> Entropy of Query Reformulation<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#entropy-of-query-reformulation"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>Inspired by previous works in analysing eye-movement sequences <span class="citation">Krejtz et al. (<a href="#ref-krejtz2015gaze">2015</a>)</span> and search tactics sequences <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-he2016beyond">He et al., 2016</a>)</span>, we employed a similar entropy analysis of query reformulation sequences issued by users.</p>
<p>If we consider the sequence of query reformulations issued by a participant
(e.g., <em>New -&gt; New -&gt; Specialization -&gt; Specialization -&gt; Word Substitution -&gt; Generalization</em>)
then this sequence can be considered as a first order Markov chain (wherein, the next step in the chain depends only on the current state).
Entropy analysis on these Markov chains quantifies how predictable the states are, and yields two categories of uncertainty measures: transition entropy, <span class="math inline">\(H_t\)</span>, and stationary entropy <span class="math inline">\(H_s\)</span>.</p>
<p>In the context of query reformulations, the maximum <strong>transition entropy</strong> <span class="math inline">\((s \log s)\)</span> can be reached when there is an equal probability of switching between each of the <span class="math inline">\(s = 5\)</span> QRTs (query reformulation types).
The minimum transition entropy (0) is achieved in a fully deterministic Markov chain where all transition probabilities are either 1 or 0.
This means that with a higher transition entropy there is more randomness in the participant’s transitions between different QRTs.
This randomness is an indication that the participants do not have a clear progression from one QRT to another.
On the other hand, a lower transition entropy indicates that the participant’s transition between QRTs are highly predictable.
<strong>Stationary entropy</strong> is calculated from the distribution of QRTs.
A higher stationary entropy value indicates that the QRTs were used uniformly, while a lower stationary entropy indicates that some QRTs are preferred over others.
Values of stationary entropy vary between 0 and <span class="math inline">\((\log s)\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(s\)</span> is the number of possible states (QRTs) <a class="footnote-ref" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content='&lt;p&gt;The explanation is adapted from &lt;span class="citation"&gt;He et al. (&lt;a href="#ref-he2016beyond"&gt;2016&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>16</sup></a>.</p>
<!-- A higher query reformulation entropy indicates a greater degree of uncertainty or randomness in the user's query reformulation behaviour, indicating that the user may be struggling to find relevant information or is uncertain about their information needs. In contrast, a lower query reformulation entropy suggests a more systematic and directed approach to search, indicating that the user has a clearer understanding of their information needs and is using query reformulation strategies to efficiently retrieve relevant information. Query reformulation entropy is a useful metric for evaluating the effectiveness of search systems and understanding user search behaviour.

Transition entropy is a metric that measures the uncertainty or randomness in the transitions between different search states, such as between queries, documents, or web pages. It quantifies the level of unpredictability or randomness in the user's navigation behavior as they move from one state to another, and can be used to evaluate the efficiency and effectiveness of search systems and interfaces.

Stationary entropy, on the other hand, measures the uncertainty or randomness in the distribution of user behavior within a single search state. For example, it can be used to analyze the frequency and distribution of query terms used by a user during a search session, or the distribution of clicks on search results pages. Stationary entropy provides insights into the structure and characteristics of user search behavior within a given context, and can be used to optimize search algorithms and ranking models. -->

<p>As the sample sizes were often small, and / or did not match the normality assumptions of parametric tests, we have employed the non-parametric Mann-Whitney U test for all the null-hypothesis testing. This allows easy comparison between different categories of results.</p>
<p>What about learning??
What are the measures of learning?</p>
<p>Transition analysis and entropy helps to cover differences in disparate tasks and activities (get text from Qvardford paper)</p>
<ul>
<li>Also see Yung Sheng’s Dissertation</li>
<li>think hard about which data component has not been touched / analysed</li>
</ul>
<p>Hypotheses from <span class="citation">He et al. (<a href="#ref-he2016beyond">2016</a>)</span>:</p>
<p>The second set (H2) compares two different user groups, experts and novices, using one of the search systems in two different conditions. The H2 hypotheses illustrate how a focus on search tactics provides a different lens to view search logs.</p>
<ul>
<li>H2.1: Search experts are likely to be more predictable in their choice of search tactics compared to novices</li>
<li>H2.2: Search experts have developed a set of search tactics they prefer over others, while novices use search tactics more uniformly.</li>
<li>H2.3: While working with a search system novices will find a preferred method of transitioning from one search tactic to another. In other words, their search tactics transitions will become more predictable over time.</li>
<li>H2.4: While working with a search systems novices will find preferred search tactics to use. In other words, their distribution of search tactics will become less uniform over time.</li>

    - longitudinal task
        - A / B

    ✅ Number of terms per query:

      - for different task types
      - query_reform_{Hs, Ht}
      - 🧠 always use closed state space for better entropy

    📌 characterizing words in query according to difficulty
      - freq in vocabulary / specialized terms
        - whether this changes over time

    ✅ No. of clicks per query
    - query_click_n_{sum, avg, sd}
  
    📌 Abandoned queries (Percentage of queries with no clicks) ==> per task
    - query_abandoned_pct_{sum, avg, sd}
    - only 56 queries were without clicks
    
    ✅ generate report containing each variable (cols?), and each task name (rows)
    like CHI SRC paper

    📃 create graphs

Sequences

✅ Transition and Stationary Entropies
- Change in entropy with time (Qvardfort paper)
- Transition matrix density (ET bibile Sec 10.7.2)

- Patterns from Russell Paper
  - Short Navigation: [BREAK]* -> S -> X -> BREAK
  - Topic Exploration: S –> X –> X –> X –> X –> …
  - Methodical Results Exploration: S –> X –> S –> X –> S …
  - Query Refinement: S –> S –> S –> S …

- query without clicks
  
- [Overall / Beginning / Middle / End of task] x [LPA Profiles]
  ✅ Entropies
  - Patterns
  - Sequence Lengths ==> no. of actions performed.


✅ Number (Count) of unique URLs (webpages) visited [visit_n_{sum,avg,sd}]
- url_n
    _{lweb, lpub, lother, iweb, ipub, iother, misc, all}
    _{sum, avg, sd}
    _{whole, beg, mid, end}

⏳ Dwell Times on webpages [dwell_{category}_{sum,avg,sd}] - seconds
  - url_dur
    _{lweb, lpub, lother, iweb, ipub, iother, misc, all}
    _{sum, avg, sd}
    _{whole, beg, mid, end}

^^ Already Too much

📃 Viz: LPA Profile Mean + Transition parallel categories (like CHI paper)
- generate for each profile (60)
- extract HTML for each plot, and put all of them together in one HTML file

🚨🚨 LEARNING OUTCOME!!! 🚨🚨 
- grades

Task Time
  - task_dur_{sum, avg, sd}
  - maybe too much, because need to exclude IDLE time from task
  - or, aka, `url_dur_all_sum` is an indicator of `task_dur`?


Other Time
  - time between queries [later]



Unique domains
  - Percentage and number of unique  clicked domains



- 

📃 Viz: Distributions of all tactics - tables / bars / etc.
