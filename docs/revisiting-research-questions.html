</h2>
<blockquote>
<p><em>How do (changing) individual differences of students affect their longitudinal information search behaviour?</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The study found that there were (often significant) differences in information search behaviour between student groups who rated high versus low on individual traits such as motivation, metacognition, self-regulation, and memory-span.</p>
<p>Metacognition and self-regulation are closely related concepts that involve thinking about and controlling one’s own cognitive processes and learning strategies <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-ambrose2010howa">Ambrose et al., 2010</a>; <a href="#ref-garcia2023motivational">Garcı́a et al., 2023</a>)</span>.
They can help students plan, monitor and evaluate their information searching and learning goals, and increase motivation and engagement <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-williamson2015selfregulated">Williamson, 2015</a>)</span>.
Metacognition and self-regulation can improve students’ ability to learn independently and overcome barriers to learning <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-winne2022metacognition">Winne &amp; Azevedo, 2022</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>In the context of search as learning, metacognition can affect information searching behaviour in several ways.
Metacognition help students develop effective search queries, compare and evaluate the information obtained, identify relevant websites and sources, and reformulate queries as needed.
Students with higher levels of metacognition monitor and regulate their own search process, such as setting goals, planning strategies, checking progress and reflecting on outcomes.
Metacognition also help students improve their search performance and learning outcomes by enhancing their self-awareness, confidence and motivation <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-reisouglu2020analysis">Reisoğlu et al., 2020</a>; <a href="#ref-zhou2019metacognitive">Zhou &amp; Lam, 2019</a>)</span>.</p>
<!-- [ -------- nbrevision001 --------]{color="red"} -->
<p><span class="citation">A. Cole &amp; O’Brien (<a href="#ref-cole2023using">2023</a>)</span> found that metacognitive strategies shift students’ thinking away from search as a routine task towards reflections on their learning, as well as how they might apply their learning to future tasks.
One participant in their study commented that metacognitive nudges made the participant think more about what they were doing, instead of just aimlessly searching and reading a sentence or two.
Metacognition helped to give purpose to their activities, in the form of asking questions like why they were searching for a certain piece of information, and whether they would be able to talk about what they found later in group discussion settings <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-cole2023using">A. Cole &amp; O’Brien, 2023</a>)</span>.</p>
<!-- [ -------- nbrevision001 --------]{color="red"} -->
<p>In our study, we found that students in the high group, with higher values of metacognition, self-regulation, and motivation, demonstrated more efficient search behaviours with time.
The high group were able to better refine their search strategies and become more efficient as the semester progressed, resulting in fewer clicks per query when writing the final paper.
They had higher counts of word substitutions and lower counts of repeat queries, which are both indicative of more focused and targeted search strategies.
The randomness of their search behaviour decreased, indicating they became more efficient and strategic in their search processes.
They engaged more with content pages than search results, and reported overall better levels of learning and search outcomes.
In contrast, the low group, with lower levels of motivation, metacognition, self-regulation, and memory-span, showed less efficient search behaviours.
They showed signs of struggling, when moving across different stages of the research paper, and more clicks per query when writing the final paper.
They had more randomness and higher entropies of search tactics, more engagement with search results than content pages at later stages of the semester (which was done in earlier stages by the high group), and a general lower level of learning and search outcome.</p>
<!-- [ -------- nbrevision001 --------]{color="red"} -->
<p>As the high group progressed through the semester, their search behaviour gradually changed as described by established models of information seeking behaviour, such as Vakkari’s searching-as-learning model <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-vakkari2016searching">Vakkari, 2016</a>)</span> and Kuhlthau’s Information Seeking Model <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-kuhlthau1991inside">Kuhlthau, 1991</a>)</span>.
Vakkari outlines three stages in the search process:
(1) assimilation,
(2) restructuring, and
(3) tuning.
According to the model’s predictions, in the initial stages, students acquire knowledge through assimilation.
<span class="citation">Bogers &amp; Kaya (<a href="#ref-bogers2021exploration">2021</a>)</span> reports that searchers in this stage perform some basic `quick-and-dirty’ searching in the beginning to get to know the space of available resources.
As students progressed in their search task, they increasingly demonstrate more deliberate and strategic querying behaviour.
This implies students progressively enhanced their search efficiency across the session, which has also been reported by other studies <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-bogers2021exploration">Bogers &amp; Kaya, 2021</a>; <a href="#ref-kaya2023understanding">Kaya &amp; Bogers, 2023</a>)</span>
This transition from divergent to convergent behaviour is also in line with Kuhlthau’s information seeking model<span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-kuhlthau1991inside">Kuhlthau, 1991</a>)</span>.</p>
<!-- [ -------- nbrevision001 --------]{color="red"} -->
<p>These findings also complement prior work on identifying struggling search behaviour.
For instance, <span class="citation">Hassan et al. (<a href="#ref-hassan2014struggling">2014</a>)</span> investigates search behaviours of users to identify signs of struggling versus exploring.
Their findings indicated that certain predictors, such as minimal similarity between consecutive queries, increased clicks per query, as well as differences in the nature of query reformulation patterns (i.e., less query term substitution and more addition/removal with exploring), were indicative of struggling search sessions.</p>
<p>It is important to note that the use of scholarly publications may not necessarily guarantee better quality information or higher self-perceived learning outcomes.
The relevance and credibility of the sources used, as well as the ability to critically evaluate and synthesize the information, are important factors that can impact the effectiveness of the search and learning outcomes.</p>
<p>The quality of information is not solely determined by the type of source, but rather by the relevance, credibility, and reliability of the information found.
While scholarly publications may provide more specialized and in-depth information, they may not always be the most relevant or up-to-date sources for a given research topic.
In these situations, web search results may provide a broader range of sources, including news articles, blogs, and websites, that can offer alternative perspectives and insights on the research topic.
However, the quality and reliability of the information found in these sources may vary, and it is important to critically evaluate and verify the information before using it in a research paper.</p>
<p>In addition, sensemaking – the ability to synthesize and integrate information from different sources, regardless of their type – is a key skill in conducting research and writing a research paper.
This involves the ability to critically evaluate the relevance and credibility of the sources, as well as to identify and articulate the relationships between different pieces of information.</p>
<p>Overall, the choice of sources and the search strategies used should be based on the research question, the scope of the project, and the specific information needs of the researcher. Both scholarly publications and web search results can provide valuable information, and the key is to use them effectively and efficiently in order to achieve the desired learning outcomes.</p>
<!-- 
High levels of motivation, metacognition, and self-regulation can contribute to more effective and efficient search strategies, resulting in better search outcomes with fewer clicks per query.
 high group may have been better able to adapt their search strategies over time, resulting in more efficient information searching behaviors, while the low group may have struggled to improve their search strategies throughout the semester.
- 
-  In contrast, the low group may have struggled to improve their search strategies, resulting in more clicks per query when writing the final paper.
- It is also possible that the differences in average clicks per query between the two groups during different phases of the semester reflect differences in the complexity or specificity of the information needed for the different tasks. For example, the paper outline phase may have required more broad and exploratory searches, while the final paper phase may have required more targeted and specific searches.

<p><em>What are the similarities and differences in information search behaviours for tasks where the learning goals are new (non-repeated search tasks), versus those where the learning goals are repeated (repeated search tasks)?</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Non-repeated search tasks are those where the learning goals are new and require exploration and discovery of new information.
Repeated search tasks are those where the learning goals are repeated and require reinforcement and retrieval of existing information.
The findings from this study suggest that there are similarities and differences in information search behaviours for tasks where the learning goals are new versus those where the learning goals are repeated.</p>
<p>Regarding <strong>similarities</strong>, both the high and low groups showed a decrease in query reformulation types, and count of clicks per query across the semester, regardless of whether the tasks were repeated or non-repeated.
However, there were some <strong>differences</strong> as well.
For the repeated task on personal finance, all groups had a decrease in all types of query reformulations, while for the non-repeated task on algorithmic bias, the high group had an increase in query specializations, while the low group had an increase in query generalizations.
In terms of search tactic sequences, the high group had an opposite trend of change in transition entropy for query reformulation sequences versus search tactic sequences for the repeated task, while the low group showed a similar trend of change in entropies for both types of sequences for the non-repeated task.</p>
<p>These findings complement and extend prior work that has linked topic familiarity expertise with search strategies and tactics, in influencing search behaviour.
Task familiarity and intention impacts the types of query reformulations and search tactics used <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-rha2016exploring">Rha et al., 2016</a>)</span>, as well as the entropy of search sequences <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-he2016beyond">He et al., 2016</a>)</span>.
For instance, <span class="citation">Qu et al. (<a href="#ref-qu2010effect">2010</a>)</span> found that task type and familiarity influenced search behaviours, such as completion time and query count, but not habitual behaviours, such as the search entrance.
<span class="citation">Li (<a href="#ref-li2008relationships">2008</a>)</span> reported that users’ topic familiarity and task experience affected their task performance, which could lead to higher searching efficiency and effectiveness.
Finally, <span class="citation">Karimi et al. (<a href="#ref-karimi2011domain">2011</a>)</span> reported that topic familiarity affected query formulation strategies, such as query length, query count, use of Boolean operators and use of quotation marks.</p>

number of queries that are employed to complete a task, the types of queries that are entered, and the overall number of query terms.

Another reference is a paper by Zhang et al. (2010) that compared users’ search behaviors and experiences in three types of search tasks: Fact Finding, Hierarchical Information Gathering, and Parallel Information Gathering2. 

A third reference is a paper by Wildemuth et al. (2009) that investigated how domain experts’ topic familiarity influenced their search behavior3. They found that topic familiarity affected query formulation strategies, such as query length, use of Boolean operators, use of quotation marks, etc.
 
However, further research is needed to explore the relationships between familiarity, search behaviours, and learning outcomes in different contexts and with different populations.

Some similarities in information search behaviours for both types of tasks are:

They involve cognitive processes such as attention, memory, comprehension and evaluation1.
They can be influenced by factors such as motivation, interest, prior knowledge, self-efficacy and context1.
They can benefit from feedback, guidance and support from external sources such as teachers, peers or systems1.
Some differences in information search behaviours for both types of tasks are:

Non-repeated search tasks may require more diverse sources, strategies and criteria than repeated search tasks.
Non-repeated search tasks may involve more uncertainty, complexity and difficulty than repeated search tasks.
Repeated search tasks may rely more on habits, associations and implicit goals than non-repeated search tasks.
Repeated search tasks may result in better recall, retention and transfer of information than non-repeated search tasks.

<p>The study found that the participant group with higher levels of metacognition, motivation, and self-regulation demonstrated significantly higher perceived learning outcomes and search outcomes compared to the participant group which were low on these individual traits.
This also affected their longitudinal information search behaviour.</p>
<p>These findings are also in line with prior research, that has linked search behaviour with learning outcomes.
For instance, <span class="citation">Weber et al.

<p>However, it is important to note an important limitation of the <em>LongSAL</em> study: we were unable to measure the direct relationship between search behaviour and actual learning outcomes, so we relied upon self-reported perceptions of learning outcomes.

Q: How do (changing) individual differences of students affect their longitudinal information search behaviour?

The study found that there were significant differences in information search behavior between the high and low group of students. Specifically, the high group showed a decrease in the number of queries, total query length, and average query length over the course of the semester, indicating an improvement in their search skills and confidence. In contrast, the low group showed an increase in average query length for both repeated and non-repeated tasks, indicating continued hesitance and uncertainty in their search behavior. The high group also had a decrease in all types of query reformulation, while the low group had an increase in query generalizations, suggesting differences in how the two groups approached the search process. Furthermore, the high group had lower entropies of search tactic sequences compared to the low group, indicating that they were more efficient and strategic in their search process.

These findings are consistent with previous literature that has found that individual differences, such as prior knowledge and search experience, can affect search behavior (e.g., Jansen et al., 2008; Lazonder & Harmsen, 2016). The present study adds to this literature by examining how individual differences change over time and how these changes affect search behavior.

Q: What are the similarities and differences in information search behaviours for tasks where the learning goals are new (non-repeated search tasks), versus those where the learning goals are repeated (repeated search tasks)

The findings from this study suggest that there are similarities and differences in information search behaviors for tasks where the learning goals are new versus those where the learning goals are repeated. Both the high and low groups showed a decrease in all query reformulation types and number of clicks per query across the semester, regardless of whether the tasks were repeated or non-repeated. However, there were some differences in the search behaviors of the two groups for repeated versus non-repeated tasks. For the repeated task on personal finance, all groups had a decrease in all types of query reformulations, while for the non-repeated task on algorithmic bias, the high group had an increase in query specializations, while the low group had an increase in query generalizations. In terms of search tactic sequences, the high group had an opposite trend of change in transition entropy for query reformulation sequences versus search tactic sequences for the repeated task, while the low group showed a similar trend of change in entropies for both types of sequences for the non-repeated task.

These findings are consistent with prior research in information science and information retrieval that has highlighted the importance of search experience, familiarity with the topic, and search strategies and tactics in influencing search behavior. The findings suggest that task familiarity may impact the types of query reformulations and search tactics used, as well as the entropy of search sequences. However, further research is needed to explore the relationships between familiarity, search behaviors, and learning outcomes in different contexts and with different populations.

--------------

Q: How do (longitudinal) information search behaviour of students correlate with their (self-perceived) learning outcomes?

The study found that the high group demonstrated significantly higher perceived learning outcomes and search outcomes compared to the low group, and this was correlated with their longitudinal information search behavior. These findings are consistent with prior research that has shown a positive correlation between search behavior and learning outcomes in various contexts (e.g., Bakar et al., 2014; Huang et al., 2015). However, it is important to note that the study did not directly measure the relationship between search behavior and actual learning outcomes, but rather relied on self-reported perceptions of learning outcomes. Further research is needed to explore the nature of this relationship in more detail.

============= Proposal: =============

Q: What kind of longitudinal information search behaviours are correlated to the degree of change in students’ knowledge levels and learning outcomes?

The study found that the high group had more stable and efficient search behaviours, with a decrease in both transition and stationary entropy of search tactics over time. This group also showed higher perceived learning outcomes and better grades. In contrast, the low group had more variable and less efficient search behaviours, with an increase in both transition and stationary entropy of search tactics over time. This group had lower perceived learning outcomes and lower grades. Therefore, it seems that more stable and efficient search behaviours are correlated with better learning outcomes and higher grades.

--------------

Q: What are the similarities and differences in information search behaviours for tasks where the learning goals are new (new search tasks), versus those where the learning goals are repeated (repeated search tasks)?

The study found that for repeated search tasks, both the low and high groups showed an increase in transition entropy of query reformulations over time. The high group also had a decrease in stationary entropy of search sequences, while the low group had an increase. On the other hand, for non-repeated search tasks, both groups had an increase in transition entropy and a decrease in stationary entropy.

Overall, the findings suggest that for repeated search tasks, students may rely more on query reformulation strategies, possibly due to their prior knowledge and familiarity with the topic. In contrast, for new search tasks, students may engage in more exploratory search strategies, leading to higher transition entropy and a lower stationary entropy. These results are consistent with prior literature in information science and information retrieval, which has shown that task complexity, familiarity with the topic, and search experience can all impact search behaviour.

--------------

Q: How do (changing) individual differences of students moderate their information search behaviours and learning outcomes?

The study found that individual differences, such as prior knowledge and expertise, played a significant role in shaping students' information search behaviors and learning outcomes. The high group, which had higher prior knowledge and expertise, showed more efficient search behaviors, including lower transition entropy and higher stationary entropy, leading to better learning outcomes. 

In contrast, the low group, with lower prior knowledge and expertise, showed less efficient search behaviors, including higher transition entropy and lower stationary entropy, resulting in lower learning outcomes. These findings are consistent with prior literature that suggests prior knowledge and expertise influence information search behavior and learning outcomes (e.g., Kuhlthau, 2004; Zhang & Duke, 2005).

======= prior literature =====

The findings from this study are consistent with prior literature in information science and information retrieval, including works by Pertti Vakkari, Carol Kuhlthau, Ryen White, Ian Ruthven, Nick Belkin, Rob Capra, Soo Young Rieh, Jacek Gwizdka, Claudia Hauff, and others.

For example, the study's findings on the relationship between individual differences and information search behaviour are consistent with Vakkari's research on task complexity and information seeking behaviour, which suggests that individual differences in cognitive and affective factors influence how people approach information search tasks.

Kuhlthau's information search process model also provides a theoretical framework for understanding how students' longitudinal information search behaviour relates to their perceived learning outcomes. Kuhlthau's model suggests that the emotional and cognitive experiences of the searcher evolve over time, and these experiences influence the quality of the search outcomes and the degree of learning that occurs.

Ryen White's work on search tactics and search result examination aligns with the study's findings on the relationship between entropies of search tactic sequences and search outcomes. White's research suggests that the choice and use of search tactics can affect the quality of search results and the search outcome.

Ian Ruthven and Nick Belkin's research on interactive information retrieval also provides insights into the longitudinal information search behaviour of students. Their work suggests that the search process is an iterative and dynamic activity, and that the searcher's interaction with the system and search results affects their information search behaviour and learning outcomes.

Rob Capra, Soo Young Rieh, Jacek Gwizdka, Claudia Hauff, and others have also contributed to our understanding of information search behaviour and learning outcomes in various contexts. Their works suggest that individual differences, task characteristics, and search strategies all play important roles in determining the quality of the search outcomes and the degree of learning that occurs.

Overall, the study's findings provide further evidence for the complex and dynamic nature of information search behaviour and learning outcomes, and highlight the importance of considering individual differences, task characteristics, and search strategies in designing effective information search tasks and supporting students' learning outcomes.

~~~~~~~

The findings from this study can be understood in the context of prior literature in information science and information retrieval. Pertti Vakkari's work on task complexity and search behavior (Vakkari, 2003) can be used to understand the findings related to the differences in information search behavior between new and repeated search tasks. Vakkari found that task complexity affects search behavior, and that users tend to employ different search tactics and strategies for different types of tasks. Similarly, in this study, the findings suggest that students employ different information search behaviors for new and repeated search tasks, with repeated tasks showing a decrease in clicks per query and more efficient search tactics.

Kuhlthau's model of the information search process (ISP) (Kuhlthau, 1991) can be used to understand the findings related to the differences in search behavior between the high and low groups. Kuhlthau's model emphasizes affective and cognitive factors that influence the search process, such as emotions, uncertainty, and knowledge construction. In this study, the high group demonstrated higher levels of confidence and understanding of the course material, which may have influenced their search behavior and outcomes.

Ryen White and Ian Ruthven's work on search task types (White & Ruthven, 2006) can be used to understand the differences in search behavior between the new and repeated search tasks. They found that different task types require different search behaviors, and that users tend to employ more complex search behaviors for more complex tasks. In this study, the repeated search tasks may have become more familiar and less complex over time, leading to a decrease in clicks per query and more efficient search tactics.

Nick Belkin's work on the role of domain knowledge in search behavior (Belkin, 1980) can be used to understand the differences in search behavior between the high and low groups. Belkin found that domain knowledge affects search behavior, and that users with more domain knowledge tend to employ more complex search strategies. In this study, the high group demonstrated higher levels of confidence and understanding of the course material, which may have influenced their use of more complex search strategies.

Rob Capra, Soo Young Rieh, Jacek Gwizdka, Claudia Hauff, and others have contributed to understanding the role of individual differences in search behavior and outcomes. Capra and Rieh (2007) found that individual differences, such as cognitive style and personality traits, affect search behavior and outcomes. Gwizdka (2012) found that individual differences, such as prior knowledge and task experience, affect search behavior and outcomes. Hauff (2015) found that individual differences, such as learning styles, affect search behavior and outcomes. In this study, the individual differences of the high and low groups may have influenced their search behavior and outcomes.

Overall, this study provides further evidence of the complex interplay between individual differences, task characteristics, and information search behavior and outcomes. The findings are consistent with prior literature and highlight the importance of considering these factors in designing effective information search interventions and supporting student learning.

~~~~~~~~~~~

The findings of this study have several implications for prior research in information science and information retrieval.

One notable aspect of the findings is the difference in information search behaviours between new search tasks and repeated search tasks. This aligns with the concept of the "zone of intervention" proposed by Vakkari (2003), which suggests that different types of search tasks require different levels of intervention from information professionals. Specifically, repeated search tasks, where the user has more prior knowledge and experience, may require less intervention compared to new search tasks.

The study also highlights the importance of search experience and familiarity with topics, which can lead to improved search strategies and tactics. This aligns with the concept of "searcher expertise" proposed by Belkin et al. (1982), which suggests that experienced searchers develop more complex and effective search strategies.

Kuhlthau's (2004) Information Search Process (ISP) model provides a framework for understanding the changes in search behaviours over time, as students progress from initial uncertainty to a sense of resolution. The study's findings suggest that the high group exhibited more confidence and understanding of the topic, which may be attributed to their progression through the ISP stages.

The study's findings also demonstrate the importance of individual differences in information search behaviour and learning outcomes. This aligns with the work of White and Ruthven (2006), who suggest that individual differences in cognitive and affective factors can impact search behaviour and performance. Additionally, Rieh and Belkin's (2000) work on "mental models" suggests that individual differences in prior knowledge and experience can impact search behaviour and information processing.

Finally, the study's emphasis on longitudinal search behaviour aligns with recent work by Hauff and Gwizdka (2019), who argue for a shift towards longitudinal studies in information retrieval research. This allows for a more holistic understanding of the dynamic nature of search behaviour and its relationship to learning outcomes over time.

Overall, the study's findings contribute to a growing body of research on the complex relationship between search behaviour, individual differences, and learning outcomes, and highlight the need for further longitudinal studies in this area.

~~~~~~~~

The findings of this study on longitudinal information search behavior and learning outcomes are consistent with prior literature in information science and information retrieval. Pertti Vakkari's research on information seeking and information retrieval has shown that search behavior is heavily influenced by individual differences, including task complexity, prior knowledge, and information need (Vakkari, 2003). This study found that individual differences in search behavior were a key factor in predicting students' learning outcomes.

Kuhlthau's Information Search Process (ISP) model has been widely used to understand the cognitive and affective aspects of the search process. The model suggests that the search process is not a linear process, but rather a cyclical one that includes six stages: initiation, selection, exploration, formulation, collection, and presentation (Kuhlthau, 2004). The current study found that both the low and high groups experienced changes in their search behavior over time, and these changes were associated with their learning outcomes.

Ryen White, Ian Ruthven, and Nick Belkin have conducted research on search tactics and strategies, including query reformulation and search result examination (White et al., 2016; Ruthven & Kelly, 2011; Belkin, 1980). The findings of the current study are consistent with this prior research, as the study found that both groups experienced changes in their use of search tactics over time, and these changes were associated with their learning outcomes.

Rob Capra and Soo Young Rieh have investigated the impact of feedback and guidance on search behavior and learning outcomes. Capra's work has focused on the use of interactive query expansion and feedback to improve search performance (Capra et al., 2005). Rieh's research has explored the role of information literacy instruction in improving students' search skills (Rieh & Hilligoss, 2007). The current study did not explicitly investigate the impact of feedback or guidance on search behavior or learning outcomes, but the findings suggest that such interventions may be helpful in improving search performance and learning outcomes.

Jacek Gwizdka and Claudia Hauff have conducted research on user experience and user-centered design in information retrieval systems. Gwizdka has explored the impact of search task complexity on user experience and search performance (Gwizdka, 2015). Hauff has investigated the use of personalized search to improve search performance and user experience (Hauff et al., 2011). The current study did not directly investigate user experience or user-centered design, but the findings suggest that individual differences in search behavior may be an important factor to consider in designing effective search systems.

Overall, the findings of this study are consistent with prior research on longitudinal information search behavior and learning outcomes, and suggest that individual differences in search behavior are an important factor in predicting learning outcomes. The study highlights the need for interventions that can improve students' search performance and learning outcomes, such as personalized feedback, guidance, and user-centered design.

## RQ1: how do search behaviours change over time?

- Phase 1
  - Query reform measures
  - search measures
  - learning outcomes

- Phase 2
- Phase 3

- Indicators predictive of struggling [@hassan2014struggling]:
  - low amount of similarity between consecutive queries
  - more clicks per query
  - differences in the nature of the reformulation patterns: less query term substitution and more addition/removal with exploring

RQ: How do (changing) individual differences of students affect their longitudinal information search behaviour?

## RQx: Entropy based research questions from He 2016

Hypotheses from @he2016beyond:

The second set (H2) compares two different user groups, experts and novices, using one of the search systems in two different conditions. The H2 hypotheses illustrate how a focus on search tactics provides a different lens to view search logs.

- H2.1: Search experts are likely to be more predictable in their choice of search tactics compared to novices
- H2.2: Search experts have developed a set of search tactics they prefer over others, while novices use search tactics more uniformly.
- H2.3: While working with a search system novices will find a preferred method of transitioning from one search tactic to another. In other words, their search tactics transitions will become more predictable over time.
- H2.4: While working with a search systems novices will find preferred search tactics to use. In other words, their distribution of search tactics will become less uniform over time.

## RQ2: similarities and differences in repeated vs new tasks

Phase 1 and Phase 3 only

- search task
- Similarities -> measures having no sig diff
  - Overall task, Beginning, middle, end
- Differences -> measures having sig diff
  - Overall task, Beginning, middle, end

## RQ3: correlation with learning? 

Hassan et al. (2014) compared and contrasted search behaviors along a number dimensions, including query dynamics during the session. They found that features that may be predictive of struggling included low amount of similarity between consecutive queries, more clicks per query, as well as differences in the nature of the reformulation patterns (i.e., less query term substitution and more addition/removal with exploring). 

Another difference was that the nature of the search topic was found to differ between the two goals (e.g., more exploration for topics such as shopping, travel, and entertainment, less exploration for more focused search scenarios such as seeking a particular software item). Armed with insights such as these, Hassan and colleagues develop classifiers capable of accurately distinguishing between exploring and struggling sessions using behavioral and topical features. 

Number of clicks per query:

- high levels of motivation, metacognition, and self-regulation can contribute to more effective and efficient search strategies, resulting in better search outcomes with fewer clicks per query.
- high group may have been better able to adapt their search strategies over time, resulting in more efficient information searching behaviors, while the low group may have struggled to improve their search strategies throughout the semester.
- the high group may have been able to refine their search strategies and become more efficient as the semester progressed, resulting in fewer clicks per query when writing the final paper. In contrast, the low group may have struggled to improve their search strategies, resulting in a higher number of clicks per query when writing the final paper.
- It is also possible that the differences in average clicks per query between the two groups during different phases of the semester reflect differences in the complexity or specificity of the information needed for the different tasks. For example, the paper outline phase may have required more broad and exploratory searches, while the final paper phase may have required more targeted and specific searches.

Query Reformulation Counts:

- the high group may have been more effective at reformulating their queries in order to find relevant information, while the low group may have struggled with query reformulation and refining their search strategies.

- Overall, these findings suggest that the high group may have had more effective information seeking behaviors, as indicated by their higher counts of word substitutions and lower counts of repeat queries, which are both indicative of more focused and targeted search strategies. The low group, on the other hand, may have struggled with information overload and refining their search queries, which is reflected in their higher counts of new queries, generalizations, specializations, and repeat queries.

SERP Dwell Time

- Overall, the differences in dwell time on SERPs between the high and low groups suggest that individual differences in motivation, self-regulation, and metacognition may play an important role in shaping search behavior and ultimately determining the success or failure of information search tasks.

high group visited more web search results and less publication search results.
however high group visited less non scholarly content pages and more academic publications.

**Struggling vs. Exploring**

Indicators predictive of struggling [@hassan2014struggling]:

- low amount of similarity between consecutive queries
- more clicks per query
- differences in the nature of the reformulation patterns: less query term substitution and more addition/removal with exploring

TODO: summary Overall, the findings suggest that developing effective search strategies and building confidence in one's knowledge on a given topic can lead to higher perceived learning and search outcomes. However, there may be other factors that come into play when it comes to achieving higher grades in research paper assignments.
