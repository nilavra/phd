<!-- 
This Section contains a non-exhaustive list of possible variables and
operationalizations of information search behaviour collated from recent
literature.

## Query Reformulation Variables {#sec_app_vars_qry}

-   **#Queries:** the number of issued queries in a session
    [@133; @vakkari2016searching]

-   **Query Reformulation Type (QRT)**, and corresponding counts:

    -   **automated:** generalization, specialization, word
        substitution, repeat, new [@liu2010analysis]

    -   **partially manual:** generalization, specialization, parallel
        move, mission change, error correction [@boldi2009dango]

-   **#Terms per q.:** the number of terms in a query [@133]

-   **#Unique terms:** the number of unique terms in a session [@133]

-   **#Unique terms per q.:** (#Unique terms / #queries) , the number of
    unique terms per query (query vocabulary richness, QVR) [@133]

-   **#Synonyms:** number of synonyms in terms [@vakkari2016searching]

-   **%Terms from desc.:** the ratio of terms from the task description
    / assignment description [@133]

-   **%Terms from SERP:** the proportion of novel query terms found in
    the text of SERPs [@133]

-   **%Terms from content page:** the proportion of novel query terms
    found in the text of content pages [@133]

-   **%Others:** the proportion of novel query terms from other sources
    (i.e., not webpage text) [@133]

-   **Query type time:** time taken to issue the query (may not be a
    signal; will be dependent on typing speed)

-   [@downey2007models Table 3] has more linguistic features of query
    terms: web frequency, geo mean, max bigram, etc. of query terms

## SERP / Content Page Examination variables {#sec_app_vars_serp_content_pg}

-   **Transition Type:** how the browser navigated to a particular URL
    on a particular visit (Appendix
    [1.6](#sec_app_vars_transition_typ){reference-type="ref"
    reference="sec_app_vars_transition_typ"})

-   **Dwell time:** time spent on the page (seconds)

-   **Avg. page display time:** average length of time for which a
    webpage is viewed during a session [@white2009characterizing]

-   **#Clicks:** number of clicks on page

-   **Scroll depth:** how far down the page was scrolled (pixels,
    viewport proportion, % of total webpage length)

-   **Click depth:** how far down in the page was a click made

-   **Scrolled Distance:** total distance scrolled

-   **%Scroll Time:** % of time spent in scrolling

-   **Scroll speed:** indicative of reading vs scanning

-   **Scroll pattern:** entropy / scroll chaosness

-   **#Scroll direction change:** the number of times scrolling
    direction was changed --- indicative of hesitancy

-   **Non-scroll time:** % of time NOT spent in scrolling, which is
    indicative of reading

-   **#Visit-in-session:** whether first visit or revisit, in this
    session

-   **#Visit-overall:** whether first visit or revisit, in the whole
    data

-   **Number of unclicked hovers:** Median number of times for which the
    query was issued and the URL is hovered on but not clicked, per the
    earlier definition. "We selected the number of unclicked hovers as a
    feature because we found that it was correlated with clickthrough in
    our previous analysis." [@huang2011no]

-   **Cursor trail length:** Total distance (in pixels) travelled by the
    cursor on the SERP. [@huang2011no]

-   **Movement time:** Total time (in seconds) for which the cursor was
    being moved on the SERP. [@huang2011no]

-   **Cursor speed:** The average cursor speed (in pixels per second) as
    a function of trail length and movement time [@huang2011no]

-   All distances / depths can be measured using raw pixel values,
    viewport proportions and % of total webpage lengths

## SERP-only variables {#sec_app_vars_serp}

-   **Rank:** rank of result clicked

-   **Avg. SERP dwell time per query:** Total SERP Dwell Time / #queries
    entered [@collins2016assessing]

-   **Focus:** "degree to which a SERP is covered by a single topic.
    Topics may be derived based on existing class hierarchies such as
    the Open Directory Project; Experts tend to explore more narrow
    topical spaces than non-experts"
    [@eickhoff2014lessons; @rieh2016searching]

-   **Entropy:** "captures diversity across multiple topics on search
    results pages. Experts typically have higher focus, less diversity,
    and thus, lower entropy across topics" [@rieh2016searching]

## Content page-only variables {#sec_app_vars_content_pg}

-   **Avg. Content dwell time per query:** Total content page dwell time
    / #queries [@collins2016assessing]

## Overall Search Behaviour {#sec_app_vars_overall_search}

-   **Session length (time):** total time spent in the session, from
    logging software turn on to turn-off (or last page-visit, if
    turn-off time is null)

-   **Session length (pages):** no. of pages visited in session,
    including search engine home pages and result pages
    [@white2009characterizing]

-   **Session length (queries):** no. of queries issued in session
    [@white2009characterizing]

-   **#Search engines:** number of unique search engines used (will
    probably be one?)

-   **#Tabs:** number of tabs opened during the session

-   **#Windows:** number of windows opened during the session

-   **Branchiness:** no. of revisits to previous pages in the session
    that were then followed by a forward motion to a previously
    unvisited page in the session[@white2009characterizing]

-   **#Unqiue domains:** number of unique websites visited during the
    session; diversity of websites / breadth of
    coverage[@white2009characterizing]

-   **Ratio of querying to browsing:** proportion of the session that is
    devoted to querying versus browsing pages retrieved by the search
    engine or linked to from search results. A high number (much greater
    than one) means that the session was query-intensive. In contrast, a
    low number (much less than one) means that the session was
    browse-intensive[@white2009characterizing]

-   **#Bookmarks-add:** no. of bookmarks added

-   **#Bookmarks-delete:** no. of bookmarks deleted

-   **Search success:** "If the final event in a search session was a
    URL click, we scored the session as a success, and if the final
    action was a query, we score the session as a failure."
    [@white2009characterizing]

-   **Last Page Visited:** Where was the last click in a session?
    [@eickhoff2014lessons] treated sessions ending at ehow.com as
    procedural search sessions (users visiting tutorial articles), and
    sessions ending at Wikipedia as declarative search sessions.

-   **Search visualization:** as described by [@bateman2012search]

## Webpage Transition Types {#sec_app_vars_transition_typ}

In browser history API parlance, a *transition type* is used to describe
how the browser navigated to a particular URL on a particular visit.
E.g., if a user visits a page by clicking a link on another page, the
transition type is "link". The following definitions are taken from
Google Chrome Developer Website[^1].

-   **link:** The user got to this page by clicking a link on another
    page.

-   **typed:** The user got this page by typing the URL in the address
    bar. Also used for other explicit navigation actions. See also
    generated, which is used for cases where the user selected a choice
    that didn't look at all like a URL.

-   **auto_bookmark:** The user got to this page through a suggestion in
    the UI---for example, through a menu item.

-   **auto_subframe:** Subframe navigation. This is any content that is
    automatically loaded in a non-top-level frame. For example, if a
    page consists of several frames containing ads, those ad URLs have
    this transition type. The user may not even realize the content in
    these pages is a separate frame, and so may not care about the URL
    (see also manual_subframe).

-   **manual_subframe:** For subframe navigations that are explicitly
    requested by the user and generate new navigation entries in the
    back/forward list. An explicitly requested frame is probably more
    important than an automatically loaded frame because the user
    probably cares about the fact that the requested frame was loaded.

-   **generated:** The user got to this page by typing in the address
    bar and selecting an entry that did not look like a URL. For
    example, a match might have the URL of a Google search result page,
    but it might appear to the user as \"Search Google for \...\". These
    are not quite the same as typed navigations because the user didn't
    type or see the destination URL. See also keyword.

-   **auto_toplevel:** The page was specified in the command line or is
    the start page.

-   **form_submit:** The user filled out values in a form and submitted
    it. Note that in some situations---such as when a form uses script
    to submit contents---submitting a form does not result in this
    transition type.

-   **reload:** The user reloaded the page, either by clicking the
    reload button or by pressing Enter in the address bar. Session
    restore and Reopen closed tab use this transition type, too.

-   **keyword:** The URL was generated from a replaceable keyword other
    than the default search provider. See also keyword_generated.

-   **keyword_generated:** Corresponds to a visit generated for a
    keyword. See also keyword.

## Concept Map Analysis Measures {#sec_app_vars_concept_maps}

The following concept map analysis measures are adapted from
[@halttunen2005assessing].

-   The number of concepts in the beginning of instruction (beginning),

-   The number of new concepts presented in second essay (new),

-   The number of concepts in the end of instruction (end),

-   The difference between the number of concepts in the beginning and
    end of instruction (difference),

-   The number of concepts which remained same along the time (stable),

-   The number of concepts that were ignored or changed fundamentally
    along the instruction (changed/ignored),

-   The number of top-level concepts in the end (top level),

-   The number of new top-level concepts presented in the second essay
    (new top level),

-   The number of links between concept hierarchies in the end (links),

-   Maximum depth of hierarchy levels in the end,

-   The number of concepts per different levels of hierarchy in the end,

-   The number of concepts per top-level concepts i.e. hierarchies in
    the end, and

-   The level where new concepts were introduced.
