## Preference for CTA vs Silent Condition {#app-phase13-cta-v-silent}

1. You were asked to talk-aloud for one task, and work in silence for the other. Which one was better?
   - Talk aloud much was a lot better
   - Talk aloud was slightly better
   - I did not feel any difference
   - Working in silence was slightly better
   - Working in silence was a lot better

2. Why? .....

## `PHASE1-SHEG`: Website Reliability Assessment {#app-phase1-sheg}


You are researching children's health and come across this website: https://acpeds.org. 
 
Please decide if this website is a trustworthy source of information on children's health. 
 
You may use any information on this website, or you can open a new tab and do an Internet search if you want. You can consider checking out search engines other than Google, such as Bing, Yahoo, or Ecosia.
 
Take about 5 minutes to complete this task. Turn YASBIL on before proceeding.
 
 
1. Is this website a trustworthy source to learn about children's health? Explain your answer, citing evidence from the webpages you used. Be sure to provide the URLs to the webpages you cite in the next textbox. .....
2. Please paste the URLs to the webpages you used to explain your answer above, one per line. .....



## `PHASE3-SHEG`: Website Comparison Assessment {#app-phase3-sheg}

Imagine you are doing research on criminal justice reform, and you find the following webpages.

A. https://sites.psu.edu/aspsy/2019/10/20/criminal-justice-reform

B. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criminal_justice_reform_in_the_United_States
 
Which of these two webpages do you think is a better place to start your research?
 
You may use any information on the two webpages, or you can open another tab and do an Internet search if you want. You can consider checking out search engines other than Google, such as Bing, Yahoo, or Ecosia.
 
Take about 5 minutes to complete this task. Turn YASBIL on before proceeding.
 
 
1. Which of these two webpages do you think is a better place to start your research? .....
2. Explain your choice. Refer to both webpages in your answer. .....
3. Please paste the URLs to the webpages you used to explain your answer above, one per line.

## Semi-structured Interview Questions (at the end of SES3) {#app-post-task-interview}

1.  What role did searching the web for information play in the course
    you just completed?

2.  How about other courses?

3.  How do you take notes, and manage your notes? PROBE: Do you have
    some strategies to organise information?

4.  Over the course of the semester, do you think your information
    search behaviour and strategies changed? Or remained the same?

5.  I understand that Firefox may not be your usual browser. How was
    your experience of using Firefox and YASBIL to complete the
    assignments?

6.  Did you feel restricted while using Firefox?

7.  Did you ever need to switch back to your old browser while
    completing the assignments?

8.  How did you feel about using YASBIL to record your browsing
    activity?

9.  Did you feel ever "under surveillance" while using YASBIL?

10. If you were asked to redesign the way students interact with Google
    or any other Search Engine, what would you do? (PROBE: think about
    the tasks you had to do for your course, or in your daily life, or
    perhaps this study; redesign to better support student education)

11. Imagine a scenario where search engines can measure how much
    information students already know about a certain topic. Do you
    think it will be useful or desirable?

12. (if yes to previous question): What are some ways by which a search
    engine could possibly assess a student's existing knowledge? -->
