# Conclusion

longitudinal study (cohort study)

Most of the results did not have statistical significance - but that's okay because this is exploratory research, which is inductive, rather than deductive.

We were more interested in discovering interesting patterns.
We believe the findings from this study will lead to more confirmatory studies.

## Limitations

### Theoretical Limitations

Learning outcomes
Cite @urgo2022learning


### Technical Limitation

- No PDF
- N=16 to N=10
- Also check anticipated limitations section from proposal
- Did not assess goodness of fit of whether first order Markov chain is the most appropriate for modelling search tactic transitions (Besag and Mondal’s (2013) statistical test)
- did not track revisits across different tasks
- clicks may have been on popup ads, cookie consent forms, and others, instead of only links (difficult to guesstimate from HTML markup)

Some difficulties:

- opening same URL in 2 different tabs and switching between them for a while before realising one is different from the other
  - or maybe long webpage (e.g.) book - two tabs at two different locations in webpage

## Future Work

We have barely scratched the surface

- What factors are specifically responsible for the transitions or the changes in the Latent profiles at different points in the semester?
- Correlation between user profiles and search tactics [Table 9 @taramigkou2018leveraging]
- Parallel Browsing Behaviour
- Consistency of search terms (from FIRE group) -- low consistency = evidence of learning?
- Navigators vs Explorers (from IWSS)
- Struggling vs exploring
- Strategies from [@lam2007session] section 6: short nav, topic explore, etc

## Research Summary

By using Latent Profile Analysis to group participants based on their self-reported scores on motivation, metacognition, and self-regulation, we were able to identify distinct subgroups within the sample. This can help us to better understand how individual differences in these factors might relate to information searching behaviors and learning outcomes.

Using a longitudinal design with with stages of writing (proposal, outline, rough draft, and final paper) also allows us to examine how these factors and behaviors might change over time and how they might relate to each other at different stages of the writing process.

Overall, the study has the potential to provide valuable insights into the complex interplay between individual differences, information searching behaviors, and learning outcomes in the context of research paper writing.

QRTs
Overall, these findings suggest that effective query reformulation strategies may be an important factor in achieving better self-perceived learning and search outcomes among undergraduate students writing research papers. Future research could explore the specific techniques and strategies that are most effective in promoting effective query reformulation among undergraduate students.



Phase 2 I:
The differences in information behaviors observed between the high and low groups in your study can be explained by a number of factors. One possible factor is motivation: the high group may have been more motivated to conduct a thorough and comprehensive search for information, which led them to explore a wider range of topics and use a variety of sources. The low group, on the other hand, may have been less motivated, and may have focused more narrowly on specific topics or sources.

Another factor is self-regulation: the high group may have been better at managing their time and resources, which allowed them to engage with a wider range of sources and explore a broader range of topics. The low group may have struggled with time management or resource allocation, which led them to rely more heavily on a smaller set of sources or topics.

Metacognition may also have played a role: the high group may have had a better understanding of their own strengths and weaknesses as information seekers, and may have adjusted their search strategies accordingly. The low group may have had a less developed sense of metacognition, which led them to rely on familiar strategies or sources, even if those strategies or sources were not always the most effective.

Finally, memory span may have been a factor: the high group may have had a larger working memory capacity, which allowed them to process more information and make connections between different sources or topics. The low group may have had a smaller working memory capacity, which made it more difficult for them to integrate information from multiple sources or to switch between different topics or sources.

Overall, these factors likely interacted in complex ways to produce the observed differences in information behaviors between the two groups. By identifying these factors and their effects on information seeking behaviors, your study provides valuable insights into how students approach research and how their behaviors may affect their learning outcomes.

- Combining Motivation Metacognition Self regulation


### Latent Profile Analysis

Additionally, LPA can identify subgroups of individuals who may be at risk for negative outcomes, such as poor task performance, low job satisfaction, or developmental delays. This information can be used to design targeted interventions that are tailored to the specific needs of these subgroups.

In summary, LPA is a powerful and flexible person-centered statistical approach that is increasingly used in organizational psychology and child development research. Its ability to identify and describe latent subgroups within a population provides a more nuanced understanding of human behavior, and its applications have the potential to inform the design of targeted interventions that can improve outcomes for individuals and organizations.


In the context of information search behavior, LPA can be used to investigate how search behavior varies across different contexts or populations. For example, researchers may use LPA to identify different search patterns among novice versus expert users, or among different age or cultural groups. This can help to inform the design of search interfaces and other information systems that are tailored to the needs of specific user groups.

Overall, LPA is an interesting and valuable technique for understanding information search behavior because it allows researchers to move beyond simple group comparisons and identify meaningful subgroups within a population. By uncovering these subgroups, researchers can gain deeper insights into the complex and nuanced ways that people search for information online, and use this knowledge to improve the design and effectiveness of information systems.

Overall, the use of LPA to classify participants into high and low groups based on their scores on the IMI, MAI, and SRQ was an effective method for identifying individual differences in motivation, metacognition, and self-regulation. This allowed us to examine the relationship between these individual differences and search behavior, which is the focus of this study.


### Entropy
<!-- TODO: check the following text: -->
Transition analysis and entropy are powerful tools in the field of information retrieval that can help to uncover patterns in user search behaviour across disparate tasks and activities. By analysing transitions between different states, such as between queries, documents, or web pages, transition analysis can reveal important insights into how users navigate information spaces and interact with search systems. For example, it can be used to identify common search patterns or to identify areas where users may be experiencing difficulty or confusion.

Entropy, on the other hand, provides a quantitative measure of the uncertainty or randomness in user search behaviour. By calculating entropy values for different aspects of search behaviour, such as query reformulation or click-through behaviour, researchers can gain a better understanding of the structure and characteristics of user search behaviour in different contexts. This can help to identify areas for improvement in search systems and to design more effective search algorithms and interfaces.

Together, transition analysis and entropy provide a powerful framework for understanding user search behaviour and improving the design and effectiveness of search systems. By analysing transitions and quantifying the level of uncertainty in user behaviour, researchers can uncover valuable insights that can inform the development of more effective search systems and improve the overall user experience.
