# Discussion

Quick Check Results (Descriptive)

- which results have the strongest effect sizes and RBC scores?
- which users went beyond page 1 in a SERP?
<!-- - possible to track revisits across SES2a - SES2d? -->


Hypotheses from @he2016beyond:

The second set (H2) compares two different user groups, experts and novices, using one of the search systems in two different conditions. The H2 hypotheses illustrate how a focus on search tactics provides a different lens to view search logs.

- H2.1: Search experts are likely to be more predictable in their choice of search tactics compared to novices
- H2.2: Search experts have developed a set of search tactics they prefer over others, while novices use search tactics more uniformly.
- H2.3: While working with a search system novices will find a preferred method of transitioning from one search tactic to another. In other words, their search tactics transitions will become more predictable over time.
- H2.4: While working with a search systems novices will find preferred search tactics to use. In other words, their distribution of search tactics will become less uniform over time.


## Summary of Results


Number of clicks per query:

- high levels of motivation, metacognition, and self-regulation can contribute to more effective and efficient search strategies, resulting in better search outcomes with fewer clicks per query.
- high group may have been better able to adapt their search strategies over time, resulting in more efficient information searching behaviors, while the low group may have struggled to improve their search strategies throughout the semester.
- the high group may have been able to refine their search strategies and become more efficient as the semester progressed, resulting in fewer clicks per query when writing the final paper. In contrast, the low group may have struggled to improve their search strategies, resulting in a higher number of clicks per query when writing the final paper.
- It is also possible that the differences in average clicks per query between the two groups during different phases of the semester reflect differences in the complexity or specificity of the information needed for the different tasks. For example, the paper outline phase may have required more broad and exploratory searches, while the final paper phase may have required more targeted and specific searches.


Query Reformulation Counts:

- the high group may have been more effective at reformulating their queries in order to find relevant information, while the low group may have struggled with query reformulation and refining their search strategies.

- Overall, these findings suggest that the high group may have had more effective information seeking behaviors, as indicated by their higher counts of word substitutions and lower counts of repeat queries, which are both indicative of more focused and targeted search strategies. The low group, on the other hand, may have struggled with information overload and refining their search queries, which is reflected in their higher counts of new queries, generalizations, specializations, and repeat queries.


**Struggling vs. Exploring**

Indicators predictive of struggling [@hassan2014struggling]:

- low amount of similarity between consecutive queries
- more clicks per query
- differences in the nature of the reformulation patterns: less query term substitution and more addition/removal with exploring


## RQ1: how do search behaviours change over time?





- Phase 1
  - Query reform measures
  - search measures
  - learning outcomes
  - SHEG tasks

- Phase 2
- Phase 3

- Indicators predictive of struggling [@hassan2014struggling]:
  - low amount of similarity between consecutive queries
  - more clicks per query
  - differences in the nature of the reformulation patterns: less query term substitution and more addition/removal with exploring



## RWx: Entropy based research questions from He 2016

## RQ2: similarities and differences in repeated vs new tasks

Phase 1 and Phase 3 only

- search task
- SHEG tasks
- Similarities -> measures having no sig diff
  - Overall task, Beginning, middle, end
- Differences -> measures having sig diff
  - Overall task, Beginning, middle, end

SES3 SHEG - only one participant issued a query; others did not

## RQ3: correlation with learning?



<!-- Hassan et al. (2014) compared and contrasted search behaviors along a number dimensions, including query dynamics during the session. They found that there are some features that may be predictive of struggling, such as a low amount of similarity between consecutive queries, more clicks per query, as well as differences in the nature of the reformulation patterns (i.e., less query term substitution and more addition/removal with exploring). Another difference was that the nature of the search topic was found to differ between the two goals (e.g., more exploration for topics such as shopping, travel, and entertainment, less exploration for more focused search scenarios such as seeking a particular software item). Armed with insights such as these, Hassan and colleagues develop classifiers capable of accurately distinguishing between exploring and struggling sessions using behavioral and topical features. -->
