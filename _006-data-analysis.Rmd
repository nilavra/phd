## Individual Differences Questionnaires Data Analysis Steps

### Motivation, Metacognition, and Self Regulation Data


### Latent Profile Analysis (LPA)












## YASBIL Search Log Data Analysis Steps

### URL Categorization






### Active Tab Identification



### Identifying Levels of Search Activity


After log data was cleaned 
From @white2016interactions, Table 2.1 (adapted from Bates, 1989):

- **Level 1: Move**
  - Atomic search event â€“ for example, a query or click
  (*An identifiable thought or action that is part of information searching.*)
- **Level 2: Tactic**
  - Goal or task, including query or click chain
  (*One or several moves made to further a search*)
- **Level 3: Statagem**
  - Mission or session
  (*A larger, more complex set of thoughts and/or actions than the tactic; a stratagem consists of multiple tactics and/or moves, all of which are designed to exploit a particular search domain that is thought to contain the desired information*)
- **Level 4: Strategy**
  - Session or cross-session search task
  (*A plan, which may contain moves, tactics, and/or stratagems, for an entire information search.*)



Session: `task_id`, 30 minutes of inactivity
(Google Analytics: a session lasts until there's 30 minutes of inactivity)

Session duration is considered 30 minutes (!) (or maybe 1 hour?)
as per Google Analytics^[https://www.hotjar.com/google-analytics/glossary/session-duration] and (TODO: find reference)
