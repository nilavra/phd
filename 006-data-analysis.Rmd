Analysis steps:
- Check analysis ideas for more ideas
- get data for IMI, MAI, etc
-->



## Data Cleaning and Processing

## Data Analysis Approach

see crescenzi thesis

## URL Categorization

<!-- ALL IN CAPS BECAUSE I WAS DOING URL CATEGORIZATION -->

- peer-reviewed publications are `PUB`s
- others are `ARTICLE`S (e.g. Wikipedia)
- if no other info, then `WEB`
- fuzzy between `WEB` and `ARTICLE` (when classified manually)
- `ARTICLE` IF THERE IS A CLEAR AUTHOR
  - EXCEPT WIKIPEDIA, DUE TO COMMON PARLANCE
  - ENCYCLOPEDIAS
- JOURNAL HOMEPAGES ARE `WEB`
- LIST OF CHAPTERS IN A BOOK ARE `L.PUB`.
  - E.G. IN DETAIL VIEW OF
- BOOK CHAPTER IS `PUB`





## Latent Profile Analysis

- feature sets for profiling (toggle on and off)
  - IMI
  - MAI
  - SRQ
  - WMC / memory span: 
    - scaling by dividing by 10 (?) (that's the max Coglab would show)
    - min-max scaling
  - perceived learning outcome (/100)
  - perceived search outcome (/100)
  - others?



- Use LIME / SHAP and counterfactual explanations to understand which components contribute to change in Profile Membership (no no; a simple examination of what feature values changed between timepoints will be enoug)

use 2 groups! 2 groups is always better. easier to explain; easier to write.


## Dwell Time Analysis

- DO ANAYSIS WITH `LIB` AND `LIBGUIDE` TYPE URLS - LIBRARY WEBSITES
