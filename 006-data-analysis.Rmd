# Data Analysis

Note about pronouns:
all participants are referred to using gender-neutral they/them pronouns.

> _It is great to be able to participate in the research this semester. Using the extension somehow brings me postive feedback and that helps me in study I303. So I wanna say thank you_

Analysis steps:
- Check analysis ideas for more ideas
- get data for IMI, MAI, etc
-->



## Data Cleaning and Processing

## Data Analysis Approach

see crescenzi thesis



## Latent Profiles

- feature sets for profiling (toggle on and off)
  - IMI
  - MAI
  - SRQ
  - WMC / memory span:
    - scaling by dividing by 10 (?) (that's the max Coglab would show)
    - min-max scaling
  - perceived learning outcome (/100)
  - perceived search outcome (/100)
  - others?

Memory span values normalized by 10, because "The maximum memory span measurable with this experiment is ten" as per CogLab output

- Use LIME / SHAP and counterfactual explanations to understand which components contribute to change in Profile Membership (no no; a simple examination of what feature values changed between timepoints will be enoug)

use 2 groups! 2 groups is always better. easier to explain; easier to write.



## URL Categorization

<!-- ALL IN CAPS BECAUSE I WAS DOING URL CATEGORIZATION -->

- peer-reviewed publications are `PUB`s
- others are `ARTICLE`S (e.g. Wikipedia)
- if no other info, then `WEB`
- fuzzy between `WEB` and `ARTICLE` (when classified manually)
- `ARTICLE` IF THERE IS A CLEAR AUTHOR
  - EXCEPT WIKIPEDIA, DUE TO COMMON PARLANCE
  - ENCYCLOPEDIAS
- JOURNAL HOMEPAGES ARE `WEB`
- LIST OF CHAPTERS IN A BOOK ARE `L.PUB`.
  - E.G. IN DETAIL VIEW OF
- BOOK CHAPTER IS `PUB`


## Implicit Features for Exploratory Search Process

From @hendahewa2016implicit and related papers

- Creativity --> Information Novelty
  - Unique Coverage: Unique web pages visited
  - Likelihood of Discovery: Measurement of difficulty to find certain information
- Exploration
  - Total Coverage: Total number of content pages visited
  - Distinct Queries: Total number of different queries issued
  - Query diversity: Measurement of similarity between queries issued
- Knowledge Discovery --> Finding useful and relevant information
  - Useful Coverage: Number of pages where users spend a considerable amount of time
  - Relevant Coverage: Number of pages that users denote as relevant to the task



## Search Tactics

From @white2016interactions, Table 2.1:

- Level 1: Move
  - Atomic search event – for example, a query or click
- Level 2: Tactic
  - Goal or task, including query or click chain
- Level 3: Statagem
  - Mission or session
- Level 4: Strategy
  - Session or cross-session search task

  - like process mining!
  - "*Since modern search systems may allow user interactions beyond the tactics defined in the literature the tactics may need to be extended*"




- other behaviours from *Search Patterns* book
  - quit
  - narrow
  - expand
  - pearl growing / citation mining / snowballing
  - pogo sticking
  - thrashing

for LongSAL, tactics / states:
- Q
  - subdivided by Q reform types?
- L
- I\_short (DT <= 10s) -- rethink these durs
- I\_med ( 10 < DT <= 30s)
- I\_long (> 30s) 
  - 30s from Handehawa's thesis, and related Shah references
- opening a new tab: parallel mission?
- closing ta tab
- staying Idle (?) -- user stays idle for 1 minute -- as in taramigkou 2018 ip&m paper
- beginning and end of sessions?
- clicks?
  - clicks on L pages
  - clicks on I pages

or maybe I.type of webpage visited?
or combine DT with I.PUB / I.X?



### Transition analysis of Search Tactics

Transition analysis can be applied to:

- search tactics
- tabs: parallel browsing behaviour (think hard.. do we need a constant number of tabs for this to work?)
- combined (opening tab and closing tabs are tactics / events in markov process)


Help with analyses:

- Chen and Cooper (2002) used a Chi-square test to compare the distribution of transitions in search tactic transition matrices.
- [@he2016beyond p. 1220 sec 6.1] for calculation formulas for entropy of transitions
- [@krejtz2014entropy] sec 4 for calculation formulas
- [@he2016beyond p. 1220 sec 6.2] for hypotheses


## correlation analysis

- correlation between user profiles and search tactics (as in taramigkou paper table 9)

## search trails analysis

- low priority
- chirag sha's student; has intersting metrics like coverage, unique pages visited etc.
- https://rucore.libraries.rutgers.edu/rutgers-lib/49207/PDF/1/
- maybe future work?


## Dwell Time Analysis

- DO ANAYSIS WITH `LIB` AND `LIBGUIDE` TYPE URLS - LIBRARY WEBSITES
- Dwell Time:
  - overall
  - per task
  - per timepoint?
- sig diff in DT between
  - SES1 and SES3
  - SES2a and SES2d?
- checkout: sns.pairplot() -- pairwise relationships in a dataset
  - https://seaborn.pydata.org/generated/seaborn.pairplot.html
- checkout seaborn's plotting capabilites!
