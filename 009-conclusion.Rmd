## Contributions

From ASIST award session

FOLLOW UP WITH ...

- Change of the self, self-reflection
- Look at anthropology perspective

ROB:

- Look at qualitative data. More interesting

HEATHER:

- what can we share back to the teachers of the course, librarians and others


## Limitations

- No PDF
- N=16 to N=10
- Also check anticipated limitations section from proposal
- Did not assess goodness of fit of whether first order Markov chain is the most appropriate for modelling search tactic transitions (Besag and Mondal’s (2013) statistical test)
- did not track revisits across different tasks

Some difficulties:

- opening same URL in 2 different tabs and switching between them for a while before realising one is different from the other
  - or maybe long webpage (e.g.) book - two tabs at two different locations in webpage
