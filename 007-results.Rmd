# Results and Discussion


What about learning??
What are the measures of learning?


- Also see Yung Sheng's Dissertation
- think hard about which data component has not been touched / analysed


Hypotheses from @he2016beyond:

The second set (H2) compares two different user groups, experts and novices, using one of the search systems in two different conditions. The H2 hypotheses illustrate how a focus on search tactics provides a different lens to view search logs.

- H2.1: Search experts are likely to be more predictable in their choice of search tactics compared to novices
- H2.2: Search experts have developed a set of search tactics they prefer over others, while novices use search tactics more uniformly.
- H2.3: While working with a search system novices will find a preferred method of transitioning from one search tactic to another. In other words, their search tactics transitions will become more predictable over time.
- H2.4: While working with a search systems novices will find preferred search tactics to use. In other words, their distribution of search tactics will become less uniform over time.

## Descriptive statistics

### profile transitions

- how the following changed over time 
  - motivation, metacognition, self regulation
  - perceived learning, perceived search outcome


## Q - query (re)formulation




## L - source selection / Item Selection

- dwell times
- "Item" selection as in IWSS

## I - interacting with sources

- dwell times

> 
> *If the dwell time is long, i.e. ≥ 5 seconds, it is more likely that a user is reading the search results summary (ER) rather than only skimming it (EI). The 5 second threshold was determined based on reading research using eye tracking (Rayner, 1998) and the size of the summaries in Querium. A time span of less than 5 seconds is a too short period for being able to read a summary and extract information.*

## Overall search behaviour




### search tactics



## SHEG tasks - information evaluation capabilities
