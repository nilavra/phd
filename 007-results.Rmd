# Results and Discussion


## Latent Profiles

TODO: Describe stats from `HI` and `LO` profiles, as in YSC Sec 5.1.

<!-- 

The rank biserial correlation [2] is the difference between the proportion of favorable evidence minus the proportion of unfavorable evidence.

The common language effect size is the proportion of pairs where x is higher than y. It was first introduced by McGraw and Wong (1992) [3]. Pingouin uses a brute-force version of the formula given by Vargha and Delaney 2000 [4]:

The advantage is of this method are twofold. First, the brute-force approach pairs each observation of x to its y counterpart, and therefore does not require normally distributed data. Second, the formula takes ties into account and therefore works with ordinal data.

Common language effect size (CLES):
the probability that a score sampled at random from one distribution will be greater than a score sampled from some other distribution.

CLES are concordant with sig_dir_mean: so use them

For repeated task (finance) HI group stopped querying from the middle of the task.
Hi group felt more certain (TODO: get quote from response?)
While LO group continued till the end to query - they were more uncertain.

## Entropy of Search tactics

R!esN7928923989685423424 is a VERY good result!
Model ID = 10

<!-- ================= OLD CONTENTS =============== -->

## COMMENT OUT: Old Content - Remove everything from here


As the sample sizes were often small, and / or did not match the normality assumptions of parametric tests, we have employed the non-parametric Mann-Whitney U test for all the null-hypothesis testing. This allows easy comparison between different categories of results.



What about learning??
What are the measures of learning?

Transition analysis and entropy helps to cover differences in disparate tasks and activities (get text from Qvardford paper)


- Also see Yung Sheng's Dissertation
- think hard about which data component has not been touched / analysed


Hypotheses from @he2016beyond:

The second set (H2) compares two different user groups, experts and novices, using one of the search systems in two different conditions. The H2 hypotheses illustrate how a focus on search tactics provides a different lens to view search logs.

- H2.1: Search experts are likely to be more predictable in their choice of search tactics compared to novices
- H2.2: Search experts have developed a set of search tactics they prefer over others, while novices use search tactics more uniformly.
- H2.3: While working with a search system novices will find a preferred method of transitioning from one search tactic to another. In other words, their search tactics transitions will become more predictable over time.
- H2.4: While working with a search systems novices will find preferred search tactics to use. In other words, their distribution of search tactics will become less uniform over time.


<!-- ## Discussion - Research Questions -->

## RQ1: - how do search behaviours change over time?

- Phase 1
  - Query reform measures
  - search measures
  - learning outcomes
  - SHEG tasks

- Phase 2
- Phase 3

- Indicators predictive of struggling [@hassan2014struggling]:
  - low amount of similarity between consecutive queries
  - more clicks per query
  - differences in the nature of the reformulation patterns: less query term substitution and more addition/removal with exploring

## RQ2: repeated vs new tasks

Phase 1 and Phase 3 only

- search task
- SHEG tasks



## RQ3: mention here


## RQ4: mention here



## Learning Outcomes

### Correlation of SPL with Grades

- self-perceived learning (SPL)
- grades
- paired t-tests for SPL with obtained grade
- CONCL: obtained grades are not good indicators of learning


## Qualitative / Free Text Results

Note-taking strategies

- how do you organize your notes
- how long do you store your notes
- how do you search for a bit of info in the notes

Other surveys




## Quick Check Results (Descriptive)

- which results have the strongest effect sizes and RBC scores?
- which users went beyond page 1 in a SERP?
- possible to track revisits across SES2a - SES2d?
- 




## Descriptive statistics

### profile transitions

- how the following changed over time 
  - motivation, metacognition, self regulation
  - perceived learning, perceived search outcome

    ✅ Number of terms per query:

    ✅ Number (count) of queries per search task:

      - {overall, beginning, middle, end} of tasks
      - for different task types
      - query_reform_{Hs, Ht}
      - 🧠 always use closed state space for better entropy

    📌 characterizing words in query according to difficulty
      - freq in vocabulary / specialized terms
        - whether this changes over time

    ✅ No. of clicks per query
    - query_click_n_{sum, avg, sd}
  
    📌 Abandoned queries (Percentage of queries with no clicks) ==> per task
    - query_abandoned_pct_{sum, avg, sd}
    - only 56 queries were without clicks
    
    ✅ generate report containing each variable (cols?), and each task name (rows)
    like CHI SRC paper

    📃 create graphs

    Query Location: where did participants query?
    - Google, Library, etc

    

  TODO: across time, somehow

## L - source selection / Item Selection

- dwell times
- "Item" selection as in IWSS

## I - interacting with sources

- dwell times

> 
> *If the dwell time is long, i.e. ≥ 5 seconds, it is more likely that a user is reading the search results summary (ER) rather than only skimming it (EI). The 5 second threshold was determined based on reading research using eye tracking (Rayner, 1998) and the size of the summaries in Querium. A time span of less than 5 seconds is a too short period for being able to read a summary and extract information.*

Sequences

✅ Transition and Stationary Entropies
- Change in entropy with time (Qvardfort paper)
- Transition matrix density (ET bibile Sec 10.7.2)

- Patterns from Russell Paper

  - Topic Exploration: S –> X –> X –> X –> X –> …
  - Methodical Results Exploration: S –> X –> S –> X –> S …
  - Query Refinement: S –> S –> S –> S …

- query without clicks

  ✅ Entropies
  - Patterns
  - Sequence Lengths ==> no. of actions performed.


✅ Number (Count) of unique URLs (webpages) visited [visit_n_{sum,avg,sd}]

^^ Already Too much

📃 Viz: LPA Profile Mean + Transition parallel categories (like CHI paper)
- generate for each profile (60)
- extract HTML for each plot, and put all of them together in one HTML file

🚨🚨 LEARNING OUTCOME!!! 🚨🚨 
- grades

Task Time
  - task_dur_{sum, avg, sd}
  - maybe too much, because need to exclude IDLE time from task
  - or, aka, `url_dur_all_sum` is an indicator of `task_dur`?


Other Time
  - time between queries [later]



Unique domains
  - Percentage and number of unique  clicked domains
