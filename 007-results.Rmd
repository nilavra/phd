# Results and Discussion


As the sample sizes were often small, and / or did not match the normality assumptions of parametric tests, we have employed the non-parametric Mann-Whitney U test for all the null-hypothesis testing. This allows easy comparison between different categories of results.



What about learning??
What are the measures of learning?

Transition analysis and entropy helps to cover differences in disparate tasks and activities (get text from Qvardford paper)


- Also see Yung Sheng's Dissertation
- think hard about which data component has not been touched / analysed


Hypotheses from @he2016beyond:

The second set (H2) compares two different user groups, experts and novices, using one of the search systems in two different conditions. The H2 hypotheses illustrate how a focus on search tactics provides a different lens to view search logs.

- H2.1: Search experts are likely to be more predictable in their choice of search tactics compared to novices
- H2.2: Search experts have developed a set of search tactics they prefer over others, while novices use search tactics more uniformly.
- H2.3: While working with a search system novices will find a preferred method of transitioning from one search tactic to another. In other words, their search tactics transitions will become more predictable over time.
- H2.4: While working with a search systems novices will find preferred search tactics to use. In other words, their distribution of search tactics will become less uniform over time.


<!-- ## Discussion - Research Questions -->

## RQ1: - how do search behaviours change over time?

- Phase 1
  - Query reform measures
  - search measures
  - learning outcomes
  - SHEG tasks

- Phase 2
- Phase 3

- Indicators predictive of struggling [@hassan2014struggling]:
  - low amount of similarity between consecutive queries
  - more clicks per query
  - differences in the nature of the reformulation patterns: less query term substitution and more addition/removal with exploring

## RQ2: repeated vs new tasks

Phase 1 and Phase 3 only

- search task
- SHEG tasks



## RQ3: mention here


## RQ4: mention here



## Learning Outcomes

### Correlation of SPL with Grades

- self-perceived learning (SPL)
- grades
- paired t-tests for SPL with obtained grade
- CONCL: obtained grades are not good indicators of learning


## Qualitative / Free Text Results

Note-taking strategies

- how do you organize your notes
- how long do you store your notes
- how do you search for a bit of info in the notes

Other surveys




## Quick Check Results (Descriptive)

- which users went beyond page 1 in a SERP?
- possible to track revisits across SES2a - SES2d?




## Descriptive statistics

### profile transitions

- how the following changed over time 
  - motivation, metacognition, self regulation
  - perceived learning, perceived search outcome


## Q - query (re)formulation

<!-- 

Difference between timepoints (across all profiles?)
Difference between profiles (across all times)
Mix (?)

For everything below: change in mean and sig diff over time / task type
    - repeated task
        - A / B
    - non-repeated task
        - A / B
    - longitudinal task
        - A / B

    ✅ Number of terms per query: 
      - query_len_{sum, avg, sd}

    ✅ Number (count) of queries per search task: 
      - query_n_{sum, avg, sd}

    ✅ Number (count) of reformulated query types:
      - query_reform_gen_{sum, avg, sd}
      - query_reform_spec_{sum, avg, sd}
      - query_reform_wsub_{sum, avg, sd}
      - query_reform_rpt_{sum, avg, sd}
      - query_reform_new_{sum, avg, sd}

    ✅ Entropy of query reformulation types
      - {overall, beginning, middle, end} of tasks
      - for different task types
      - query_reform_{Hs, Ht}
      - 🧠 always use closed state space for better entropy

    📌 characterizing words in query according to difficulty
      - freq in vocabulary / specialized terms
        - whether this changes over time

    ✅ No. of clicks per query
    - query_click_n_{sum, avg, sd}
  
    📌 Abandoned queries (Percentage of queries with no clicks) ==> per task
    - query_abandoned_pct_{sum, avg, sd}
    - only 56 queries were without clicks
    
    ✅ generate report containing each variable (cols?), and each task name (rows)
    like CHI SRC paper

    📃 create graphs

    Query Location: where did participants query?
    - Google, Library, etc

    

  TODO:

TODO: across time, somehow

### Number of terms per query

- change in mean and sig diff over time / task type
  - repeated task
  - non-repeated task
  - longitudinal task

### Number of queries per search task


### Number of reformulated query types


### Query Location

## L - source selection / Item Selection

- dwell times
- "Item" selection as in IWSS

## I - interacting with sources

- dwell times

> 
> *If the dwell time is long, i.e. ≥ 5 seconds, it is more likely that a user is reading the search results summary (ER) rather than only skimming it (EI). The 5 second threshold was determined based on reading research using eye tracking (Rayner, 1998) and the size of the summaries in Querium. A time span of less than 5 seconds is a too short period for being able to read a summary and extract information.*

## Overall search behaviour

- sig diffs at (beginning, middle and end of tasks) x (LPA profiles)

<!--

Sequences

✅ Transition and Stationary Entropies
- Change in entropy with time (Qvardfort paper)
- Transition matrix density (ET bibile Sec 10.7.2)

- Patterns from Russell Paper
  - Short Navigation: [BREAK]* -> S -> X -> BREAK
  - Topic Exploration: S –> X –> X –> X –> X –> …
  - Methodical Results Exploration: S –> X –> S –> X –> S …
  - Query Refinement: S –> S –> S –> S …

- query without clicks
  
- [Overall / Beginning / Middle / End of task] x [LPA Profiles]
  ✅ Entropies
  - Patterns
  - Sequence Lengths ==> no. of actions performed.


✅ Number (Count) of unique URLs (webpages) visited [visit_n_{sum,avg,sd}]
- url_n
    _{lweb, lpub, lother, iweb, ipub, iother, misc, all}
    _{sum, avg, sd}
    _{whole, beg, mid, end}

⏳ Dwell Times on webpages [dwell_{category}_{sum,avg,sd}] - seconds
  - url_dur
    _{lweb, lpub, lother, iweb, ipub, iother, misc, all}
    _{sum, avg, sd}
    _{whole, beg, mid, end}

^^ Already Too much

📃 Viz: LPA Profile Mean + Transition parallel categories (like CHI paper)
- generate for each profile (60)
- extract HTML for each plot, and put all of them together in one HTML file

🚨🚨 LEARNING OUTCOME!!! 🚨🚨 
- grades

Task Time
  - task_dur_{sum, avg, sd}
  - maybe too much, because need to exclude IDLE time from task
  - or, aka, `url_dur_all_sum` is an indicator of `task_dur`?


Other Time
  - time between queries [later]



Unique domains
  - Percentage and number of unique  clicked domains
