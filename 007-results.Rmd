# Results and Discussion

- Also see Yung Sheng's Dissertation
- think hard about which data component has not been touched / analysed


Hypotheses from @he2016beyond:

The second set (H2) compares two different user groups, experts and novices, using one of the search systems in two different conditions. The H2 hypotheses illustrate how a focus on search tactics provides a different lens to view search logs.

- H2.1: Search experts are likely to be more predictable in their choice of search tactics compared to novices
- H2.2: Search experts have developed a set of search tactics they prefer over others, while novices use search tactics more uniformly.
- H2.3: While working with a search system novices will find a preferred method of transitioning from one search tactic to another. In other words, their search tactics transitions will become more predictable over time.
- H2.4: While working with a search systems novices will find preferred search tactics to use. In other words, their distribution of search tactics will become less uniform over time.




## Q - query reformulation

Yung Sheng's Dissertation:

### Number of terms per query

### Number of queries per search

### Number of reformulated query types


## L - source selection

- dwell times

## I - interacting with sources

- dwell times

> 
> *If the dwell time is long, i.e. ≥ 5 seconds, it is more likely that a user is reading the search results summary (ER) rather than only skimming it (EI). The 5 second threshold was determined based on reading research using eye tracking (Rayner, 1998) and the size of the summaries in Querium. A time span of less than 5 seconds is a too short period for being able to read a summary and extract information.*

## Overall search behaviour

  - like process mining!
  - "*Since modern search systems may allow user interactions beyond the tactics defined in the literature the tactics may need to be extended*"




- other behaviours from *Search Patterns* book
  - quit
  - narrow
  - expand
  - pearl growing / citation mining / snowballing
  - pogo sticking
  - thrashing

for LongSAL, tactics:
- Q
- L
- I
- opening a new tab: parallel mission?


### tab transition / parallel browsing behaviour

- Chen and Cooper (2002) used a Chi-square test to compare the distribution of transitions in search tactic transition matrices.
- [see @he2016beyond p. 1220] to get formula for entropy of transitions


## SHEG tasks - information evaluation capabilities

> *We've confused young people’s ability to operate digital devices with the sophistication they need to discern whether the information those devices yield is something that can be relied upon*
