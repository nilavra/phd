It takes a village to raise a child.
It is impossible to even begin to properly acknowledge all the amazing people who have impacted my PhD journey in the last half a decade of doctoral experience.
I was extremely lucky to have my Academic Village spread across five continents: Asia, Europe, North America, South America, and Australia; and fifty-three people from all over the world attended my doctoral dissertation defense, which was conducted online on Thursday, 11 May 2023, at 9AM US-Central Time.

I would like to take this opportunity to express my gratitude to these groups of fantastic people who have supported me throughout this incredible journey. Without your encouragement, humour, and frequent supply of food, completing this PhD would have been a far more arduous task. So, from the depths of my cola-zero and Tacos-de-pescado fueled soul, thank you!

**Doctoral advisor, Prof. Jacek Gwizdka:** I have been fortunate enough to encounter a supernova of guidance and support in the form of the most awesome PhD advisor in the world. Words alone cannot capture the depth of my gratitude, but I will attempt to express my heartfelt appreciation nonetheless.
To my incredible PhD advisor, Jacek, you have been more than just a mentor. 
Your brilliance as a researcher and scholar is surpassed only by your dedication to nurturing the minds and spirits of your students. 
You possess the unique ability to challenge and inspire, to encourage and motivate, all while maintaining an infectious enthusiasm for our shared field of study. 
It is your genuine care for your students that sets you apart. You have created an environment where intellectual growth thrives, where curiosity is nurtured, and where laughter is not only welcomed but encouraged. Your open-door policy and willingness to listen, not just to academic concerns but also to personal struggles, have provided solace during the challenging times of this journey. 
Your mentorship extends far beyond the realm of research, shaping me not only as a scholar but also as a compassionate human being.
Thank you for the numerous lunches and dinners around the world: Warsaw, Glasgow, Vienna, Frankfurt, Austin, Pittsburgh, and hope to keep it counting in the years to come.




**Dissertation committee members:**
Professors Soo-Young Rieh, Matt Lease, and Rob Capra: thank you for your guidance and expert advice. You are the kindest dissertation committee in the universe. Your patience in reading countless drafts, deciphering my sleep-deprived ramblings, and offering insightful feedback during both the dissertation proposal and the defense has been invaluable. I promise to use my newfound knowledge for good, and not to subject you to any more pun-filled introductions. 
<!-- You rock! -->
Special thank you to Professor Pertti Vakkari, for being an ever-present mentor for my dissertation research  since the CHIIR 2021 doctoral consortium, and also for inviting me to Tampere University in Finland in October 2022. 


**Participant and study facilitators:**
To the brave souls who participated in the SALpilot and LongSAL studies, your willingness to endure my never-ending surveys and quirky experiments has contributed immensely to the advancement of knowledge. Your dedication and contributions are deeply appreciated, and I promise that your efforts have not been in vain. You're the real superheroes of this doctoral research endeavour!

Thank you, Professor Ken Fleischmann, and other co-instructors of the Spring 2022 I303 course: Dr. Nitin Verma, Dr. Ayse Gursoy, Dr. John Robert Bautista, and Jaxsen Day, for graciously giving me access to your I303 course for recruiting study participants.
Thank you, Quinn Stewart, Molly McGee, and Rajashree Kamat, for helping to facilitate the pilot study (SALpilot) of this dissertation research.
Without your unwavering help and support, this dissertation would have been impossible.



**Doctoral students at the School of Information, University of Texas at Austin:**
To my fellow compadres at the UT iSchool: you've been more than just classmates – you've been my sanity-saving squad. From late-night discussion sessions to commiserating over failed experiments, we've navigated the treacherous seas of research together.
Thank you, Li Shi, for being an awesome ever-present colleague and officemate, providing me with a near-permanent front seat in your shiny Audi, and offering to drive this poor souls all around Austin.
Thank you to my other officemates, Chongyan Chen and Takayuki Suzuki, for the numerous dinner outings in Austin, after which we named our WhatsApp group "China Family Restaurant".
Thank you recently-Dr. Nitin Verma (congratulations!), and soon-to-be Drs. Nathan Davis and Kristina Shiroma, for being in the same boat with me during the dissertation phase and being awesome sounding boards for my crazy ideas.
Thank you, Angie Zhang, for the awesome headshot photos that you took of me. They have changed my LinkedIn game completely.
Thank you, Tina Lassiter, and Hana Frluckaj, for answering hundreds of of my Europe-related questions.
Thank you, Ayesha Bhimdiwala, Yujin Choi, Anubrata Das, Ajay Jaiswal, Isabella Schloss, Chelsea Collier, Yung-Sheng Chang (and all the others that I have missed) for your endless support, laughter, and camaraderie. May our future research endeavours be filled with fewer bugs and more breakthroughs!



**Faculty and administration at University of Texas at Austin:**
To the vibrant and incredible community at the School of Information, and more broadly to the University of Texas at Austin, you've provided the perfect blend of intellectual stimulation and burnt-orange spirit. Your collective brilliance has inspired me to reach higher and think deeper. 
Thank you, Professor Randolph Bias and Cheryl Bias, for repeatedly hosting us in your lovely home in Manor, TX, over many fun-filled intellectual discussions about experimental design, statistics, teaching pedagogy, or random facts of life, while sitting around the firepit. 
Thank you, Professor Andrew Dillon, for always being incredibly positive and encouraging about the process of writing, which made me take your writing studio class thrice. Also, I wish you the heartiest congratulations for the very recent ASIS\&T 2023 Award of Merit. No one deserves it more than you do.
Thank you, Dean Eric Meyer, for being a brilliant leader for our iSchool. Your policy to include doctoral students in the faculty hiring committees has been a total game changer for me and fellow doctoral students. We learnt so much from merely sitting at those meetings and discussions about faculty hiring that would just never be possible from any place else.
Thank you, Dona Kurtz, for being ever present for any questions and concerns, and stewarding the iSchool through thick and thin.
Thank you, Sam Burns, Philip Jones, and Quinn Stewart, for the last six years' worth of IT help and support that you have given me, and our Information eXperience (IX) lab.
From the greater UT community, thank you, Elizabeth Korves, for managing the UT scholarship process for hundreds or maybe thousands of students every year, and always being ever present for any questions via email. It is a huge thankless task, and I want to thank you for smoothly administering it for so many years, and hopefully many more years to come.

Original template:

This is where you will normally thank your advisor, colleagues, family and friends, as well as funding and institutional support. In our case, we will give our praises to the people who developed the ideas and tools that allow us to push open science a little step forward by writing plain-text, transparent, and reproducible theses in R Markdown.

We must be grateful to John Gruber for inventing the original version of Markdown, to John MacFarlane for creating Pandoc (<http://pandoc.org>) which converts Markdown to a large number of output formats, and to Yihui Xie for creating `knitr` which introduced R Markdown as a way of embedding code in Markdown documents, and `bookdown` which added tools for technical and longer-form writing.

Special thanks to [Chester Ismay](http://chester.rbind.io), who created the `thesisdown` package that helped many a PhD student write their theses in R Markdown. And a very special thanks to John McManigle, whose adaption of Sam Evans' adaptation of Keith Gillow's original maths template for writing an Oxford University DPhil thesis in LaTeX provided the template that I in turn adapted for R Markdown.

Finally, profuse thanks to JJ Allaire, the founder and CEO of [RStudio](http://rstudio.com), and Hadley Wickham, the mastermind of the tidyverse without whom we'd all just given up and done data science in Python instead. Thanks for making data science easier, more accessible, and more fun for us all.
