# Prior Work: Pilot Study {#ch_pilot_study}

## SES1: Initial Session

<!-- A pilot study was conducted in the Summer of 2021 at the School of
Information, University of Texas at Austin (Texas iSchool). This was
mainly a feasibility study to determine the technical logistics and
participant retention rates. It included SES1, SES2, and SES3 from the
proposed study procedure (Figure
[\[fig_study_procedure\]](#fig_study_procedure){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig_study_procedure"}). There was no recording of individual
differences via recruitment, mid-term, and final surveys. It also did
not include submission of concept maps. Eight students from two courses
at the Texas iSchool -- *Academic Success in the Digital University*
(ACS), and *Information in Cyberspace* (CYB) -- participated in the
pilot study. The study ran from start of June 2021 to mid-August 2021.
There was no participant drop-off. Synchronous sessions (SES1 and SES3)
were conducted over the Zoom video conferencing platform. Log data was
captured using the YASBIL browser extension [@bhattacharya2021yasbil].
All setup and technical logistics worked out properly, without any major
technological issues. Details of the search task descriptions are
presented below. Participants were compensated with USD 15 for SES1, 15
points of extra course credit for longitudinal tracking in SES2, and USD
15 for SES3.

## SES1: Initial Session

Participants performed a training task to familiarise themselves with
the YASBIL browser extension. The they performed two search tasks as
described below. Each search task was followed by measurement of mental
workload using NASA-TLX.

 \
**Task 1: Financial Literacy** (Repeated in SES3)

::: displayquote
Money management and financial literacy are essential life skills, and
what better time to learn about them than in college? Write a note to
your future self, about essential money-related advice and skills that
college students should know and practice.

**What to do:**

-   Find at least 3 unique, good quality online resources that are
    relevant to this topic

-   Look for resources that help establish connections and develop a
    narrative

**What to deliver:**

-   Write a summary of the lessons, advice, and/or tips you found across
    the different resources. This is a note to your future self, so the
    narrative can be in a format that is most useful and interesting to
    YOU

-   Paste the links of ALL the resources that you finally selected to
    develop your narrative, in the second text box, one link per line

**Task 2: Social Media during COVID-19** (Topic was part of course
content in ACS and CYB)

::: displayquote
"What was the role of Social Media during the COVID-19 pandemic? How did
it affect people's lives during quarantine and social distancing?"
Suppose a family member (say your aunt) or a friend asked you these
question over a phone call, and you want to talk to them on this topic
for a couple of minutes.

**What to do:**

-   Find at least 3 unique, good quality online resources that are
    relevant to this topic

-   Look for resources that help establish connections and develop a
    narrative

**What to deliver:**

-   Write a short summary of the content that you found across the
    different resources. The length and writing style can be such that
    you can read it out to your family member/friend over a phone call,
    without them losing interest.

-   In the summary, briefly mention your thoughts about each resource -
    do you agree or disagree with the content in the resource? Anything
    else?

-   Paste the links of ALL the resources that you finally selected to
    develop your narrative, in the second text box, one link per line

## SES2: Longitudinal Tracking

The longitudinal tracking session SES2 involved student participants
submitting log data for two final-project assignments for the ACS
course, and four final project assignments for the CYB course.
Participants received reminder emails to log and sync their data a few
days before each assignment was due. Seven (out of 8) participants
logged their data and synced it with our data server in a timely
fashion, without major technical issues. One participant CYB course
forgot to log their data for the first two assignments, despite the
email reminder. However, upon following up with them, they remembered to
log their data for the third and fourth sessions.

## SES3: Final Session {#sec_app_pilot_ses3}

All eight participants from SES1 completed SES3 (no drop off).
Participants performed two search tasks, and one website reliability
evaluation task as described below. All three tasks were followed by
measurement of mental workload using NASA-TLX. At the end of the tasks,
they underwent a short semi-structured interview to reflect on their
overall study experience. The interview questions can be found in
Appendix
[\[app_post_task_interview\]](#app_post_task_interview){reference-type="ref"
reference="app_post_task_interview"}.

**Task 1: Financial Literacy** (Repeated from SES1)

::: displayquote
At the start of the semester, you wrote a note to your future self,
about essential money-related advice and skills that college students
should know and practice.

Here is what you wrote:\
`[dynamic content showing participants’ previous responses]`

Here are the resources you took help from:\
`[dynamic content showing participants’ previous responses]`

Now you have a chance to **update or revise the note with more
information**. You can either choose to write afresh, or copy-paste the
note from above into the first textbox below and add to it /edit it.
Feel free to search the web if you need to, after turning YASBIL on. You
can choose **NOT to search**, as well.

If you do choose to search, please paste the links of ALL the resources
that you finally selected for updating your note, one link per line, in
the second textbox. The links can be the same ones you visited earlier,
or different.

Did you need to search the web for updating the note? Why?

**Task 2: HTML CSS** (Topic was part of course content in ACS and CYB)

::: displayquote
In your course, you studied about websites, HTML, and CSS. Therefore,
for answering the questions below, **you may choose NOT to search the
web**, if you feel you can answer the questions reasonably well. If you
do need to search the web, feel free to do so, after turning on YASBIL.

As you understand these concepts, please explain (with examples if
necessary)

1.  what is the purpose of HTML?

2.  what is the purpose of CSS?

3.  how do HTML and CSS come together when someone visits a website?

List as many HTML tags as you can, one per line, in the following
format:\
`[HTML tag] - [few words explaining the function of the tag]`

List as many CSS properties as you can, one per line, in the following
format:\
`[CSS property] - [few words explaining the function of the property]`

Did you need to search the web for this task? Why?

**Task 3: Website Reliability Evaluation** (From Stanford History
Education Group[^1])

::: displayquote
You are researching children's health and come across this website:

[`https://acpeds.org`](https://acpeds.org){.uri}.

Please decide if this website is a trustworthy source of information on
children's health. You may use any information on this website, or you
can open a new tab and do an Internet search if you want. Take about 5
minutes to complete this task. Turn YASBIL on before proceeding.

Is this website a trustworthy source to learn about children's health?
Explain your answer, citing evidence from the webpages you used. Be sure
to provide the URLs to the webpages you cite in the next textbox.

Please paste the URLs to the webpages you used to explain your answer
above, one per line.

**Grading Rubric for Task 3 (as provided by SHEG):**

::: displayquote
This task presents students with the website of the American College of
Pediatricians (ACPeds.org) and asks them whether it is a trustworthy
source to learn about children's health. Despite the site's professional
title and appearance, the American College of Pediatricians is not the
nation's major professional organization of pediatricians. That
designation belongs to the similarly named American Academy of
Pediatrics. The American College of Pediatricians is a conservative
advocacy organization established in 2002 in response to the American
Academy of Pediatrics' support of adoption by same-gender couples. The
American College of Pediatricians website features a mission statement
that reads, in part, "We recognize the basic father-mother family unit,
within the context of marriage, to be the optimal setting for childhood
development." News releases on the site include headlines like,
"Same-Sex Marriage -- Detrimental to Children" and "Know Your ABCs: The
Abortion Breast Cancer Link."

 \
This exercise is an open web search in which students are free to stay
on the American College of Pediatricians site or leave it to search for
information about the group. Successful students will look beyond the
surface features of the site and detect its agenda from its new releases
or other focus issues. A faster route, however, is to leave the site
almost immediately to search for reliable information about the true
agenda of this organization.

 \
**Mastery:** Student rejects the website as a trustworthy source and
provides a clear rationale. Student provides reliable supporting
evidence and cites the source of information.

**Emerging:** Student rejects the website as a trustworthy source and
provides supporting evidence. However, the response falls short of
Mastery because: *(i)* Student provides relevant evidence and says where
the evidence is from, but the explanation is incomplete; *(ii)* Student
provides a complete explanation that is supported by relevant evidence
but does not say where the evidence is from.

**Beginning:** Student rejects the source but provides an incoherent,
irrelevant, or unreasonable explanation; or the student simply accepts
the source as trustworthy.

After Task 3, participants participated in a semi-structured interview
to reflect on their overall searching and learning experience, as well
as participating in the study. The questions asked in the interview are
presented in Appendix
[\[app_post_task_interview\]](#app_post_task_interview){reference-type="ref"
reference="app_post_task_interview"}.
