Learning today is about navigation, discernment, induction, and synthesis of the wide body of information on the Internet present ubiquitously at every student’s fingertips.
Learning, or addressing a gap in one’s knowledge, has been well established as an important motivator behind information-seeking activities.
The Search as Learning research community advocates that online information search systems should be reconfigured to become educational platforms to foster learning and sensemaking.
Modern search systems have yet to adapt to support this function.
An important step to foster learning during online search is to identify behavioural patterns that distinguish searchers gaining more vs. less knowledge during search.
Previous efforts have primarily studied searchers in the short term, typically during a single lab session.
Many researchers have expressed their concern over this ephemeral approach, as learning takes place over time, and is not fleeting. 
We propose an exploratory longitudinal study to analyze the long-term searching behaviour of students enrolled in a university course, over the span of a university semester. 
Our research aims are to identify if and how students’ searching behaviour changes over time, as they gain new knowledge on a subject; and how do processes like motivation, metacognition, self-regulation, and other individual differences moderate their `searching as learning' behaviour. 
Findings from this exploratory longitudinal study will help to build improved search systems that foster human learning and sensemaking, and are more equitable in the face of learner diversity.

This *R Markdown* template is for writing an Oxford University thesis. The template is built using Yihui Xie's `bookdown` package, with heavy inspiration from Chester Ismay's `thesisdown` and the `OxThesis` \LaTeX\ template (most recently adapted by John McManigle).

This template's sample content include illustrations of how to write a thesis in R Markdown, and largely follows the structure from [this R Markdown workshop](https://ulyngs.github.io/rmarkdown-workshop-2019/).

Congratulations for taking a step further into the lands of open, reproducible science by writing your thesis using a tool that allows you to transparently include tables and dynamically generated plots directly from the underlying data. Hip hooray! -->
