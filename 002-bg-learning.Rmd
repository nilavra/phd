# Background: Knowledge and Learning {#ch-bg-learn}

This first chapter on background literature discusses relevant concepts
from the disciplines of Education and Learning Sciences. First, we
introduce some relevant terminology, and the concepts of deep or
meaningful learning. Then we discuss several research backed principles
that have been shown to lead to meaningful learning. Next, we discuss
how learning, sensemaking, and searching for information are related,
and how modern technologies provide affordances for new forms of
learning and knowledge work in the 21st century. We also discuss some
concepts about individual differences of learners as well as techniques
that can promote better learning. In the last section, we state what
implications these findings have for shaping the proposed study in this
dissertation proposal.

## Terminology {#sec-bg-learn-terminology}

The Webster dictionary^[<https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/knowledge>] defines **knowledge** in two ways. The first
definition is "the range of one's information or understanding".
@vakkari2016searching says it is "the totality what a person knows,
that is, a **personal knowledge** or **belief system**. It may include
both justified, true beliefs and less justified, not so true beliefs,
which the person more or less thinks hold true." Webster's second
definition of knowledge is "the sum of what is known: the body of truth,
information, and principles acquired by humankind". We can regard this
as **universal knowledge**.

**Learning** is a *process*, that leads to a *change* in (personal)
knowledge, beliefs, behaviours, and attitudes [@ambrose2010howa]. Thus,
learning always aims to increase one's personal knowledge, and can often
draw from the body of universal knowledge. In some cases, the change in
personal knowledge can also lead to change in universal knowledge, such
as when new discoveries are made, or new philosophies are proposed.
Human learning is an innate capacity. It is longitudinal and unfolds
over time. Learning is lifelong and life-wide, and has a lasting impact
on how humans think and act [@kalantzis2012newa; @ambrose2010howa].
Learning can be informal or formal. **Informal learning** is the casual
learning taking place in everyday life, and is incidental to the
everyday life experience. **Formal learning** is the deliberate,
conscious, systematic, and explicit acquiring of knowledge
[@kalantzis2012newa].

**Education** is a form of formal learning. It is the systematic
acquiring of knowledge. In today's world, the institutions of education
are formally constructed places (classrooms), times (of the day and of
life) and social relations (teachers and students); for instance,
schools, colleges, and universities. The scientific discipline of
Education concerns itself with the systematic investigation of the ways
in which humans know and learn. It is the science of "coming to know"
[@kalantzis2012newa].

**Pedagogy** describes small sequences of learner activities that
promote learning in educational settings [@kalantzis2012newa].
Traditional approaches to (classroom) pedagogy, especially the *didactic
pedagogy*, primarily involves a teacher telling, and a learner
listening. The teacher is in command of the knowledge, and their mission
is to transmit this knowledge to the learners, in a one-way flow. It is
hoped that the learners will dutifully absorb the knowledge laid before
them by the teacher. The balance of agency weighs heavily towards the
teacher. "There is a special focus on long-term memory, or retention,
measurable by the ritual of closed-book, summative examination"
[@cope2017elearningc].

-->

Cognitive scientists had discovered that learners retain material
better, and are able to generalize and apply it to a broader range of
contexts, when they learn **deep knowledge** rather than **surface
knowledge**, and when they learn how to use that knowledge in real-world
social and practical settings [@sawyer2005cambridge]. Deep learning ^[
    of the human kind
]
takes place when "the learner chooses conscientiously to integrate new
knowledge to knowledge that the learner already possesses" and involves
"substantive, non-arbitrary incorporations of concepts into cognitive
structure" [@novak2002meaningful p. 549] and may eventually lead to the
development of transferable knowledge and skills. A parallel terminology
for deep learning [@marton1976qualitative_a; @marton1976qualitative_b]
is **meaningful learning**
[@ausubel1968educational; @novak2002meaningful], and they are often
contrasted with *surface learning* or *rote learning*.

details on deep or meaningful learning, and the limitations of
traditional classroom practices to promote deep learning.

reference="fig-meaningful-learning"}  -->
describes (using a concept map) how
meaningful learning can be achieved and sustained, and our annotations
highlight how Search-as-learning systems can foster the same.

## Principles of Meaningful Learning {#sec-bg-learn-principles}

@ambrose2010howa have proposed several principles of (student)
learning that lead to creation of deeper knowledge in learners, and help
educators understand why certain teaching approaches may help or hinder
learning. These principles are based on research and literature from a
range of disciplines in psychology, education, and anthropology, and the
authors claim they are domain independent, experience independent, and
cross-culturally relevant.

1. Students' **prior knowledge** can help or hinder learning.
2. How students **organize knowledge** influences how they learn and apply what they know.
3. Students' **motivation** determines, directs, and sustains what they do to learn.
4. Goal-directed practice coupled with **targeted feedback** enhances the quality of students' learning.
5. Students' current level of development interacts with the social, emotional, and intellectual **context** around the student to impact learning.
6. To become **self-directed** learners, students must learn to **monitor and adjust** their approaches to learning.


In line with the above, the US National Research Council identified
several key principles about **experts' knowledge** [@council2000how],
that illustrate the outcome of successful learning:

1. Experts notice features and **meaningful patterns** of information
    that are not noticed by novices.
2. Experts have acquired a great deal of content knowledge that is
    **organized** in ways that reflect a deep understanding of their
    subject matter.
3. Experts' knowledge cannot be reduced to sets of isolated facts or
    propositions but, instead, reflects contexts of **applicability**:
    that is, the knowledge is 'conditionalized' on a set of
    circumstances.
4. Experts are able to **flexibly retrieve** important aspects of their
    knowledge with little attentional effort.
5. Though experts know their disciplines thoroughly, this does not
    guarantee that they are able to teach others.

6. Experts have varying levels of flexibility in their approach to new
    situations.

The principles of learning illustrate that both the *context* of
learning, and the *individual differences* of learners moderate the
learning process. The findings about expert knowledge suggests that
*incorporating new information into existing knowledge structures* in a
meaningful manner is a key aspect of learning. We discuss these concepts
in more detail in the following sections.

## Meaningful Learning as Sensemaking {#sec-bg-learn-sensemaking}

In this section, we discuss how meaningful learning can be further
qualified using the concepts of sensemaking. 
**Sensemaking**^[
    "Brenda Dervin, one of the originators of the sense-making methodology, prefers the spelling with a hyphen, while the community in computer science and more technical people in information science (e.g., SIGCHI) use sensemaking without a hyphen" [@zhang2014towards].
] is a
process that occurs when learners *connect* their *previously developed*
knowledge, ideas, abilities, and experiences together to address the
uncertainty presented by a newly introduced phenomenon, problem, or
piece of information [@ngss_sensemaking]. A significant portion of
learning is sensemaking, especially those which use recorded information
or systematic discovery to learn concepts, ideas, theories, and facts in
a domain (such as science or history) [@zhang2014towards]. The phrase
"figure something out" is often synonymous with sensemaking. Sensemaking
is generally about actively trying to figure out the way the world
works, and/or exploring how to create or alter things to achieve desired
goals [@ngss_sensemaking]. [@dervin2010sensemaking] distinguish work on
sensemaking in four fields: "Human Computer Interaction (HCI) (Russell's
sensemaking); Cognitive Systems Engineering (Klein's sensemaking);
Organizational Communication (Weick's sensemaking; Kurtz and Snowden's
sense-making); and Library and Information Science (Dervin's
sense-making)".


Many theories of learning and sensemaking revolve around the concept of
fitting new information into an existing or adapted knowledge structure
[@zhang2014towards]. The central idea is that knowledge is stored in
human memory as *structures* or *schemas*, which comprise interconnected
concepts and relationships. When new information is encountered or
acquired, the learner or sensemaker needs to actively construct a
revised or entirely new knowledge structure. Examples of some such
theories include: the *assimilation theory (theory of meaningful
learning)*
[@ausubel2012acquisition; @novak2002meaningful; @novak2010learninga; @ausubel1968educational];
the *schema theory*
[@rumelhart1977representation; @rumelhart1981accretion]; and the
*generative learning theory*
[@wittrock1989generative; @grabowski1996generative]; all of which have
their foundations in the Piagetian concepts of *assimilation* and
*accommodation* [@piaget1936origins].

**Assimilation** means addition of new information into an existing
knowledge structure. A "synonym" [@vakkari2016searching] for
assimilation is **accretion**, which is the gradual addition of factual
information to an existing knowledge structure, without structural
changes. Accretion does not change concepts and their relations in the
structure, but may populate a concept with new instances or facts.
**Accommodation** means modifying or changing existing knowledge
structures, by adding or removing concepts and their connections in the
knowledge structure. Accommodation is subdivided into *tuning* /
*weak-revision*, and *restructuring*, based on the degree of structural
changes [@zhang2014towards]. **Tuning** or **weak revision** does not
include replacing concepts or connections between concepts in the
structure, but tuning of the scope and meaning of concepts and their
connections. This may include, for example, generalizing or specifying a
concept. **Restructuring** means radically changing and replacing
concepts and their connections in the existing knowledge structure, or
creating of new structures. Such radical changes often take place when
prior knowledge conflicts with new information. New structures are
constructed either to reinterpret old information or to account for new
information [@vakkari2016searching; @zhang2014towards]. A comparison of
these types of conceptual changes can be found in [@zhang2014towards
Table 3].

### Concept Maps to enhance Sensemaking {#sec-bg-concept-maps}

<!-- 
![ Concept Map showing the key features of Concept Maps
[@moon2011applieda Fig. 1.1].
](figs/concept-map-desc.pdf){#fig-concept-map-desc width="\\linewidth"} 
-->


As we saw in the previous section, deep learning / meaningful learning /
sensemaking is a process in which new information is connected to a
relevant area of a learner's existing knowledge structure. However, the
*learner must choose* to do this, and must actively seek a way to
integrate the new information with existing relevant information in
their cognitive structure
[@novak2010learninga; @ausubel1968educational]. Learning facilitators
(e.g., teachers) can encourage this choice by using the concept mapping
technique.

A **concept-map** is a two-dimensional, hierarchical node-link diagram
(a *graph* in Computer Science parlance) that depicts the structure of
knowledge within a discipline, as viewed by a student, an instructor, or
an expert in a field or sub-field. The map is composed of concept
labels, each enclosed in a box (graph *nodes*); a series of labelled
linking lines (*labelled edges*); and an inclusive, general-to-specific
organization [@halttunen2005assessing]. Concept-maps assess how well
students see the ''big picture'', and where there are knowledge-gaps and
misconceptions. A *mind map* is a diagram similar to a concept map,
comprising nodes and links between nodes. However, mind maps emerge from
a single centre, and have a more hierarchical, tree like structure.
Concept maps are more free-form, allowing multiple hubs and clusters.
Also, mind-maps have unlabelled links, and are subjective to the
creator. There are no "correct" relationships between nodes in a mind
map. Figure 
<!-- [1.2](#fig-concept-map-desc){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig-concept-map-desc"}  -->
shows the key features of a concept
map, with the help of a concept map.

**Concept maps are therefore, arguably the most suited mechanism to
represent the cognitive knowledge structures, connections, and patterns
in a learner's mind**. Conventional tests, such as multiple choice
questions, are best at assessing students' recall of facts and guessing
skills. Their format treats information as distinct and separate items,
rather than interconnected pieces of a bigger picture. Concept maps on
the other hand, encourage learners to identify and make connections
between concepts that they know, and concepts that are new to them.
Concept maps have been used for over 50 years to provide a useful and
visually appealing way of illustrating and assessing learners'
conceptual knowledge
[@novak1984learning; @novak2010learninga; @halttunen2005assessing; @egusa2010usingb; @egusa2014howd; @egusa2014howe; @egusa2017evaluating].

Analysis of concept maps can reveal interesting patterns of learning and
thinking. Some of these measures that have been used by
[@halttunen2005assessing] are: addition, deletion, and differences in
top-level concept-nodes; depths of hierarchy; and number of concepts
that were ignored or changed fundamentally. In this regard,
[@novak1984learning] have presented well-established scoring schemes to
evaluate concept-maps: 1 point is awarded for each correct relationship
(i.e. concept--concept linkage); 5 points for each valid level of
hierarchy; 10 points for each valid and significant cross-link; and 1
point for each example.

Having discussed how deep learning / meaningful learning / sensemaking
involves creation of knowledge structures in the learner's mind, and
suitably adding new pieces of information in the knowledge structure, we
now discuss how these processes are influenced in the 21st century with
the presence of new media, digital technologies, and information
retrieval systems.

## 'New' Learning as Online Information Searching {#sec-bg-learn-active-knowledge-multiliteracy}

Digital media technologies and e-learning 'ecologies' can enable new
forms and models of learning, that are fundamentally different from the
traditional classroom practices of didactic pedagogy
[@cope2017elearningc]. Some key concepts associated with these forms of
'new learning' are described below. These concepts from the Educational
Sciences domain tie back strongly to the issues, challenges, and
research agenda being investigated by researchers in the Search as
Learning and Information Retrieval domain (Section \@ref(sec-intro-overview).

### Active Knowledge Making {#sec-bg-learn-active-knowledge-making}

The Internet and new forms of media provide us the opportunity to create
learning environments where learners are no longer mainly *consumers* of
knowledge, but also *modifiers*, *producers*, and *exchangers* of
knowledge. In **active knowledge making**, learners can, and often need
to, find information on their own using online resources. They are not
restricted to the textbook alone. The Internet is often a definitive
resource for information on any given topic. A learner can search the
web (to learn) at any time, from anywhere, on any web-enabled device.

As knowledge producers, learners search and analyze multiple sources
with differing and contradictory perspectives, and develop their own
observations and conclusions. In this process, they become researchers
themselves and learn to collaborate with peers in knowledge production.
Collaboration gives learners the opportunity to work with others as
coauthors of knowledge, peer reviewers, and discussants to completed
works. Because learners bring their own views, outlooks, and
experiences, the knowledge artefact they create is often uniquely voiced
instead of a templated "correct" response [@amina2017active].

> Learners become **active knowledge producers** (for instance, project-based learning, using multiple knowledge sources, and research based knowledge making), and not merely knowledge consumers (as exemplified in the 'transmission' pedagogies of traditional textbook learning or e-learning focused on video or e-textbook delivery). Active knowledge making practices underpin contemporary emphases on innovation, creativity and problem solving, which are quintessential 'knowledge economy' and 'knowledge society' attributes.

### Artefacts for Learning Assessment {#sec-bg-learn-artefact}

Traditionally, the focus of learning outcomes has been long term memory.
Students and learners were expected to remember a collection of facts,
definitions, proofs, equations, and other associated details. For a
significant amount of modern knowledge-work today, **memory is actually
less important**. Information is so readily accessible now that it is no
longer necessary to remember the information. Because of the
technological phenomenon, the mass of information is available
ubiquitously ^[
    as long as there is internet connection
] to a learner (or a knowledge worker), in every moment
of learning. Empirical details such as facts, definitions, proofs, or
equations do not need to be remembered today, because they can always be
looked up again [@cope2017elearningc; @amina2017active].

This creates an interesting shift in the focus of learning and knowledge
work today: *"if we are not going to measure and value long-term memory in education, what are we going to assess?"*
@cope2017elearningc suggest that **we assess the knowledge artefacts** that learners
produce. In active knowledge making, the final work ^[
    be it a project report, poster, presentation, video, software,research  paper, website, etc.
] can be proof of
the learning outcome and represent a learner's ability to use the
resources that are available [@amina2017active]. **Measure of learning can be measure of information quality and information use in artefacts.** This shows a shift in pedagogy and assessment and an
increase in personalization and individualization of learning
[@pea2014learning]. Memorizing the information on a topic is less
important, compared to the writing, synthesizing, analyzing, and
**sensemaking** of the available information that has been referenced in
the work. This shifts the focus of assessment to the quality of the
artefacts and the processes of their construction. Moreover, as
technology increases the ability to capture detailed data from formal
and informal learning activities, it can give us a new view of how
learners progress in acquiring knowledge, skills, and attributes
[@dicerbo2014impacts]. Because learning is a continuous, longitudinal
process, these advanced, technologically enhanced assessments are more
useful in understanding the learning process and knowledge development
[@amina2017active].

Assessing open-ended artefacts does come with its challenges and
limitations. First, assessing and grading artefacts requires the
development of detailed qualitative coding guides
[@wilson2013comparison]. This process involves defining grading criteria
and measuring inter-coder agreement to ensure that the coding guide is
reliable. Prior studies have scored summaries along dimensions such as
the inclusion of facts, relationships between facts, and evaluative
statements [@roy2021note; @wilson2013comparison; @lei2015effect].
Second, the quality of responses may be difficult to compare across
learners. Since this type of assessment imposes very few constraints on
the learners' responses, it may cause some learners to *satisfice*, and
not convey everything that was learned. Additionally, writing skills are
likely to vary across learners, and some may not be able to effectively
articulate everything that was learnt.

### 'Information Search and Evaluation' as and for Learning {#sec-bg-learn-info-eval}

Learning today is more about **navigation, discernment, induction, and
synthesis**, and less about memory and deduction [@cope2013new].
However, knowing the source, finding the source, and using the
information critically is important to learn and know now more than ever
before [@amina2017active]. Learners must know the social sources of
knowledge and understand and correctly use quotations, paraphrases,
remixes, links, citations, and the like in the works that they develop.
Searching and sourcing from the web entails a process of developing and
completing a work that inevitably makes learners **knowledge
producers**, as long as they can navigate and critically discern the
value of multiple sources. This is a skill that must be learned, as many
sources of information are not valid, reliable, or authentic
[@mcgrew2018can; @wineburg2016students]. Understanding the different
sources and identifying the more reliable ones are essential for
effective teaching and learning
[@mcgrew2017challenge; @mcgrew2021skipping]. This is a critical aspect
because the inability to cite properly or to use reliable resources
provides learners with misconstrued information and ideas
[@amina2017active; @breakstone2021students; @mcgrew2017challenge].

The Stanford History Education Group (SHEG) conceptualised the **Civic
Online Reasoning** (COR) curriculum ^[<https://cor.stanford.edu>] to enable students to
effectively search for and evaluate online information
[@mcgrew2020learning; @breakstone2021students; @breakstone2018we]. The
curriculum centres on asking three questions of any digital content:
*(i)* who is behind a piece of information? *(ii)* what is the evidence
for a claim? *(iii)* what do other sources say? The curriculum has
lessons and assessments for information evaluation skills such as
lateral reading [@wineburg2017lateral], identifying news versus
opinions, checking domain names, identifying sponsored content,
evaluating evidence, and practising click restraint [@mcgrew2021click].
The lessons were developed and piloted by the Stanford History Education
Group [@mcgrew2020learning; @mcgrew2018can; @mcgrew2021click]. Taken
together, these strategies will allow academics and students to better
evaluate digital content, from the perspectives of professional fact
checkers.

The purview of the *Civic Online Reasoning* curriculum is more targeted
than the expansive fields of media and digital literacy[^7], (which can
embrace topics ranging from cyberbullying to identity theft). Civic
Online Reasoning focuses squarely on how to sort fact from fiction
online, a prerequisite for responsible civic engagement in the
twenty-first century
[@breakstone2021students; @kahne2012digital; @mihailidis2013media].

## Promoting Better Learning {#sec-bg-learn-promoting-learning}

> *It is not the technology that makes a difference; it is the pedagogy.*
>
>`r nb_blockquote_author('--- @cope2017elearningc')`
>

Having discussed how meaningful learning takes place, and how it is
influenced by the presence of digital media and the mass of information
on the Internet, let us now look deeper into the learners as persons
themselves. In this section, we discuss how different cognitive and
metacognitive practices and aspects of learners can promote better
learning. These phenomena have important implications for any digital
systems that aim to foster learning.

### Externalization and Articulation {#sec-bg-learn-articulation}

The learning sciences have discovered that when learners externalize and
articulate their developing knowledge, they learn more effectively
[@council2000how]. Best learning takes place when learners articulate
their unformed and still developing understanding, and continue to
articulate it throughout the process of learning. This phenomenon was
first studied in the 1920s by Russian psychologist Lev Vygotsky.
Articulating and learning go hand in hand, in a mutually reinforcing
feedback loop. Often learners do not actually learn something until they
start to articulate it. While thinking out loud, they learn more rapidly
and deeply than while studying quietly [@sawyer2005cambridge]. The
learning sciences community is actively researching how to support
students in their ongoing process of articulation, and which forms of
articulation are the most beneficial to learning. Articulation is more
effective if it is scaffolded -- channelled so that certain kinds of
knowledge are articulated, and in a certain form that is most likely to
result in useful reflection [@sawyer2005cambridge]. Students need help
in articulating their developing understandings, as they do not yet know
how to think about thinking, or talk about thinking; their knowledge
state is *anomalous* [@belkin1982ask].

### Metacognition and Reflection {#sec-bg-learn-metacognition}

<!-- 
![image](figs/metacognition-components.pdf){width="\\linewidth"}
 -->

One of the reasons that articulation is so helpful to learning is that
it promotes *reflection* or *metacognition*. **Metacognition**, commonly
referred to as thinking about thinking, involves thinking at a higher
level of abstraction, which in turn improves thinking and learning
[@blanken2017metacognition]. It is "the process of reflecting on and
directing one's own thinking" [@council2000how p. 78], and involves
thinking about the process of learning, and thinking about knowledge.
This ties forward to the self-regulation that effective learners exhibit
(Section \@ref(sec-bg-learn-self-regulation)). Effective learners are aware
of their learning process, and can measure how efficiently they are
learning as they study.

The literature on metacognition broadly identifies two fundamental
components of metacognition: knowledge about cognition, and regulation
of cognition. **Knowledge about cognition** includes three subprocesses
that facilitate the *reflective* aspect of metacognition: declarative
knowledge (knowledge about self and about strategies), procedural
knowledge (knowledge about how to use strategies), and conditional
knowledge (knowledge about when and why to use strategies). **Regulation
of cognition** include a number of subprocesses that facilitate the
*control* aspect of learning. Five component skills of regulation have
been discussed extensively in the literature, including planning,
information management strategies, comprehension monitoring, debugging
strategies, and evaluation. The operational definitions of these
components are described in Table
<!-- 
[\[tab-metacognition-components\]](#tab-metacognition-components){reference-type="ref"
reference="tab-metacognition-components"}.  
-->.
@schraw1994assessing
developed the **Metacognitive Awareness Inventory** (MAI) survey and a
scoring guide to measure these self-reported components and subprocesses
of metacognition. The original survey consists of 52 true/false
questions (Appendix \@ref(app-mai)), such as "I consider several alternatives to a
problem before I answer", "I understand my intellectual strengths and
weaknesses", "I have control over how well I learn", and "I change
strategies when I fail to understand". The instrument has been widely
used in research, and has its reliability and validity measures
available. Later, @terlecki2018call proposed a revised version of the
MAI, using five-point Likert-scales, ranging from "I never do this" to
"I do this always". They argue that when measuring change in
metacognition over time, the Likert-scale based 'how often' questions
are more effective than dichotomous 'Yes/No' questions
[@terlecki2018call; @terlecki2020revising].

### Motivation

Self-Determination Theory (SDT). Figure adapted from

-->

<!--
**Motivation** is the process that initiates, guides, and maintains
goal-oriented behaviours [@cherry2020what]. The **Self-Determination
Theory** (SDT) represents a broad framework for the study of human
motivation and personality [@ryan2017self]. SDT differentiates the types
of motivation based on the reasons that give rise to behaviour:
intrinsic motivation and extrinsic motivation. **Intrinsic motivation**
is engaging in a task or behaviour for the rewards *inside* the task or
behaviour, such the pleasure, enjoyment and satisfaction that the
behaviour provides. It is a stable form of motivation. **Extrinsic
motivation** is engaging in a task or behaviour for the rewards
*outside* the task or behaviour, such as receiving rewards, avoidance of
punishment, gaining social approval, or achievement of a valued result.
Extrinsic motivation is on a continuum from less stable to more stable,
as illustrated in Figure [1.3](#fig-sdt-components){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig-sdt-components"}. Extrinsic motivation does not last
unless the rewards and punishments are explicitly visible
[@tahamtan2019effect; @deci2013intrinsic; @ryan2000self].

[@ryan1982control] proposed the **Intrinsic Motivation Inventory** (IMI)
(Appendix [\[app-imi\]](#app-imi){reference-type="ref"
reference="app-imi"}), a multidimensional questionnaire intended to
assess participants' subjective experience related to a target activity
in laboratory experiments. The instrument assesses participants'
interest/enjoyment, perceived competence, effort, value/usefulness, felt
pressure and tension, and perceived choice while performing a given
activity, yielding six subscale scores. The *interest/enjoyment*
subscale is considered the most indicative self-report measure of
intrinsic motivation. The *perceived choice* and *perceived competence*
concepts are theorized to be positive predictors of both self-report and
behavioral measures of intrinsic motivation. The *pressure/tension* is
theorized to be a negative predictor of intrinsic motivation. *Effort*
is a separate variable that is relevant to some motivation questions, so
it is used if its relevant. The *value/usefulness* subscale is used to
measure internalization, with the idea being that people internalize and
become self-regulating with respect to activities that they experience
as useful or valuable for themselves.

### Self-regulation {#sec-bg-learn-self-regulation}

**Self-regulation** is the ability to develop, implement, and flexibly
maintain planned behaviour in order to achieve one's goals.
Self-regulation, and more broadly, self-direction, are critical to being
an effective "lifelong" learner. Self-regulation becomes increasingly
important at higher levels of education and in professional life, as
people take on more complex tasks and greater responsibilities for their
own learning. However, these metacognitive skills tend to fall outside
the content area of most courses, and therefore, often neglected in
instruction [@ambrose2010howa p. 191]. Building on the foundational work
of [@kanfer1970self_a; @kanfer1970self_b], Miller and Brown formulated a
seven-step model of self-regulation [@miller1991self; @brown1998self].
In this model, behavioural self-regulation may falter because of failure
or deficits at any of these seven steps: *(i)* receiving relevant
information, *(ii)* evaluating the information and comparing it to
norms, *(iiii)* triggering change, *(iv)* searching for options, *(v)*
formulating a plan, *(vi)* implementing the plan, and *(vii)* assessing
the plan's effectiveness (which recycles to steps *(i)* and *(ii)*).
Although this model was developed specifically to study addictive
behaviours, the self-regulatory processes it describes are meant to be
general principles of behavioural self-control. [@brown1999self]
developed the **Self-Regulation Questionnaire** (SRQ) (Appendix
[\[app-srq\]](#app-srq){reference-type="ref" reference="app-srq"}) to
assess these self-regulatory processes through self-report. The items
were developed to mark each of the seven sub-processes of the
[@miller1991self] model, forming seven subscales of the SRQ. The 63-item
scale elicits responses in the form of 5-point Likert scale, ranging
from strongly disagree to strongly agree. Based on clinical and college
samples, the authors tentatively recommend a score of 239 and above as
high (intact) self-regulation capacity (top quartile), 214-238 as
intermediate (moderate) self-regulation capacity (middle quartiles), and
213 and below as low (impaired) self-regulation capacity (bottom
quartile).

#### Self-directed and Self-regulated Learning

As we saw in the previous sections, self-regulation, motivation, and
metacognition are key concepts that moderate the learning process. These
terms are couched in the concepts of self-regulated learning and
self-directed learning.

**Self-directed learning** (SDL) is a "process in which individuals take
the initiative, with or without the help from others, in diagnosing
their learning needs, formulating goals, identifying human and material
resources, choosing and implementing appropriate learning strategies,
and evaluating learning outcomes "[@knowles1975self p.18].
**Self-regulated learning** (SRL) can be described as the degree to
which students are "metacognitively, motivationally, and behaviourally
active participants in their own learning process" [@zimmerman1989social
p.329].

[@saks2014distinguishing]. ](figs/sdl-v-srl.pdf){#fig-sdl-v-srl
width="0.8\\linewidth"}

Often used interchangeably, self-directed learning (SDL) and
self-regulated learning (SRL) have some important similarities and
differences (Figure [1.4](#fig-sdl-v-srl){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig-sdl-v-srl"}) [@saks2014distinguishing]. SDL, originating
from adult education, is a broader, macro-level construct, and is
usually practised outside the traditional school environment. The
self-directed learner is free to design their own learning environment,
and free to plan and set their own learning goals. SRL, on the other
hand, is a narrower, micro-level construct, originating from educational
and cognitive psychology, and is mostly utilized in the school
environment. Learners do not have as much freedom as in SDL. The
instructor or facilitator often defines the learning task and the
learning goals. Self-directed learning may include self-regulated
learning, but the converse is not true
[@jossberger2010challenge; @loyens2008selfdirected]. In other words, *"a
self-directed learner is supposed to self-regulate, but a self-regulated
learner may not self-direct"* [@saks2014distinguishing]. Despite their
differences, SDL and SRL share key similarities
[@saks2014distinguishing]. First, both can be seen in two dimensions:
*(i)* *external* to the learner, as a process or series of events, and
*(ii)* *internal* to the learner, arising from the learner's
personality, aptitude, and individual differences. Second, both the
learning processes have four key phases: *(i)* defining tasks, *(ii)*
setting goals and planning, *(iii)* enacting strategies, and *(iv)*
monitoring and reflecting. Third, both SDL and SRL require active
participation, goal-directed behaviour, metacognition, and intrinsic
motivation.

In summary, metacognition is monitoring and controlling what is in the
learner's head; self-regulation is monitoring and controlling how the
learner interacts with their environment; self-regulated learning is the
application of metacognition and self-regulation to learning
[@mannion2020metacognition]; and the whole learning process is sustained
by motivation, which is desirable to be intrinsic.

## Summary and Implications for this Proposal {#sec-bg-learn-summary}

In this first chapter of the background literature review, we discussed
*(i)* what is meaningful learning, a.k.a. deep learning, or sensemaking;
*(ii)* how meaningful learning updates the learner's cognitive knowledge
structure; *(iii)* how the learning process is influenced by digital
technologies, mass of information on the Internet, and IR systems; and
*(iv)* what principles and practices learners and educators must realize
and follow to promote meaningful learning. These findings are from the
domains of Educational Sciences, Learning Sciences and Cognitive
Sciences. We argue that these are important aspects to be considered
when designing future IR or educational information systems that aim to
combine and improve the searching and learning experience.

Guided by these findings, we make some important decision choices for
the proposed longitudinal study in this dissertation proposal. We aim to
situate learners in their context, and incorporate their individual
differences using metacognition, motivation, and self-regulation
characteristics. Additionally, we aim to assess learning using artefacts
and concept maps. We choose not use traditional tests like
question-answers, and multiple choice assignments, since they are often
not the preferred choice of knowledge-work output in real world
scenarios. Concept maps are better suited to represent the learning and
sensemaking process, and artefacts are better able to demonstrate a
learner's knowledge work.

In the next chapter, we look at relevant literature from the Information
Sciences and Interactive Information Retrieval disciplines.
