# Results from `PHASE2`: Longitudinal Searching for Writing Research Paper


All statistical tests are two-tailed Mann-Whitney U test.

As the sample sizes were often small, and / or did not match the normality assumptions of parametric tests, we have employed the non-parametric Mann-Whitney U test for all the null-hypothesis testing. This allows easy comparison between different categories of results.



Additionally, we also report Common Language Effect Size (CLES) for each statistical test result.
The common language effect size is the proportion of pairs where $x$ is higher than $y$. 
In other words, it is the probability that a score sampled at random from one distribution will be greater than a score sampled from some other distribution. 
CLES was first introduced by McGraw and Wong (1992) [TODO]. The Python statistical library employed in data analysis -- Pingouin [@vallat2018pingouin] -- uses a brute-force version of the formula given by Vargha and Delaney 2000 [TODO]:
The advantage is of this method are twofold. First, the brute-force approach pairs each observation of x to its y counterpart, and therefore does not require normally distributed data. Second, the formula takes ties into account and therefore works with ordinal data.

In the interest of better presentation and readability of this chapter, more ancillary plots are presented in Appendices \@ref(app-plots-query) and \@ref(app-plots-search).

We employed Latent Profile Analysis (LPA) to identify groups (latent profiles) of participants based on their scores on the Intrinsic Motivation Inventory (IMI), Metacognitive Awareness Inventory (MAI), and Self-regulation questionnaire (SRQ).
<!-- We employed To classify participants into high and low groups based on their self-reported scores on these questionnaires, we employed LPA.  -->
LPA is particularly useful when the relationship between variables is not well understood, or when it is difficult to determine which variables should be used to classify individuals into groups.


The results of the LPA showed that there were two distinct latent profiles of participants based on their scores on the IMI, MAI, and SRQ: a high group and a low group (Figure \@ref(fig:lpa-profile-model-57)). The high group had generally higher scores on the IMI, MAI, and SRQ compared to the low group, indicating that they were more intrinsically motivated, more aware of their metacognitive processes, and had higher levels of self-regulation.

## Q: Query Formulations


### Length of Queries

ResP3914747988879627169 | ResN7152194718394476899

Query length was operationalized as the number of terms (words separated by spaces) in the search query that participants submitted to the search engines or other information retrieval sites.
Query length can vary from a single word to several phrases or a full sentence. 
<!-- Search engines use algorithms to analyze search query length and interpret the intent of the user's search in order to provide the most relevant search results.  -->
Longer search queries may indicate a more specific or complex information need, while shorter search queries may be more general or broad in scope.
<!-- The number of terms in each query was aggregated over each participant-task pair, to obtain total, average, and standard deviation (variability) of query length. -->

The average length of queries issued by the two groups was not very different during the Proposal (`PHASE2A`), Outline (`PHASE2B`), and Final Paper (`PHASE2D`) (Figure ResP3914747988879627169).
However, the difference in average query length between the two groups was almost significant during the Rough Draft stage (`PHASE2C`), with the low group issuing around 8 words per query, whereas the high group issuing about 4 words per query. 


 <!-- high group was slightly higher than the low group during the Proposal , and then became much less during the o  -->
<!-- were always longer than those issued by the low group, except before the Outline (`PHASE2B`) and the Final Paper submission (`PHASE2D`) (Figure \@ref(fig:ResP2136245316506143308)). -->
<!-- For all tasks,  the high group issued longer queries than the low group (Figure ResP4090733126835336320),  -->
<!-- The low group, with lower levels of motivation, metacognition, and self-regulation, were issuing queries which were often two terms (words) shorter on average, than the corresponding queries from the high group. -->

The total query length for the low group increased monotonically over the semester during (Figure \@ref(fig:ResN7152194718394476899)), with the longest queries being issued by this group before the Final Paper submission phase (`PHASE2D`).
On the other hand, queries from the high group were the longest during the Outline phase (`PHASE2B`), and then it decreased in the subsequent phases.
This indicates that the high group, with higher levels of motivation, metacognition, and self-regulation, were planning ahead in the early parts of the semester to find their references. 
On the other hand, the low group, with lower levels of those traits, possibly demonstrated a tendency to procrastinate or delay their work until the final paper.
A quote from participant `P006_HANOI` illustrates this phenomenon:

> *"so far for this rough draft I haven't actually had to google anything since I downloaded everything into pdfs during the outline stage and haven't needed any new material so far."*
>
> `r nbQuoteAuthor("--- P006_HANOI")`
>

<!-- 
LO group had highest total query length before final paper (ResN5894660104957913932)


HI group had highest average query length during rough draft (ResP6726131652814458688)

LO group was slacking and putting it off till last minute.

 -->



  

### Number of Queries per Search Task

While 

Number of queries per search task refers to the number of separate queries or search attempts that a participant issued in order to complete a task. 
<!-- having the same information need. -->
<!-- single information-seeking task on a search engine or other information retrieval system. A search task is typically defined as a specific information need or question that the user is attempting to answer through a series of search queries.  -->
This measure may vary depending on the complexity of the information need, the user's level of expertise with the search system, and other factors. 
<!-- This metric is commonly used in information retrieval research to evaluate the effectiveness of search systems and user search behavior. -->

The number of queries issued per task (Figure \@ref(fig:ResP8027181930754266114)) followed a similar pattern as the total query length (Figure \@ref(fig:ResN7152194718394476899)).
The low group issued a steadily increasing number of queries as they progressed through the semester, from the Proposal to the Final Paper phase, overtaking the high group at the Outline phase.
Additionally, as their average query length was quite low while writing the Final Paper, it appears they were issuing a large number of small queries, indicating signs of struggling or exploring.
In contrast, the high group decreased their query submissions after the Outline phase, signifying they may have already collected the information they need in the earlier parts of the semester.
<!-- issued higher number of queries during the early part of the semester -- Proposal and Outline -- but then they issued lower number of queries during the later parts of the semester, w.r.t. the high group.  -->
<!-- The difference in the number of queries issued by the two groups approached statistical significance while writing the Rough Draft.  -->


<!-- were the highest before the Rough Draft (`PHASE2C`) . -->


<!-- Like avg query length, LO group issued highest number of queries when writing final paper, while HI roup did that during outline.
Even, one participant commendted "I had downloaded all the papers I needed during..." -->








### Query Reformulation Types (QRTs)

Query reformulation refers to the process of modifying or refining a search query in order to improve the relevance of search results and better match the user's information needs (Section \@ref(sec-bg-search-query)). 
Query reformulation typically occurs due to a searcher's improved understanding of how to better translate their information need into a search query.
Using the taxonomy proposed by @liu2010analysis (Figure \@ref(fig:res-Q-QRT-txnmy)), we classified each previous-next query pair issued by participants into one of the five query reformulation types (QRTs):
New,
Generalization,
Specialization,
Word Substitution,
and 
Repeat.

We faced a challenge in disentangling **Repeat** queries from "hub-and-spoke" behaviour, where the user goes back and forth between the SERP and a content page by using the browser's forward and back buttons ^[The SERP is the hub, which represents the initial point of inquiry, while the spokes represent the subsequent branches of exploration along different content pages. This search behaviour is often used when users have a general idea of the topic they are interested in, but need to explore different facets of the topic to narrow down their search and find relevant information.].
Each back button press on the browser (to go back to the SERP from a content page) meant a fresh HTTP GET request was sent to the search engine. 
This resulted in YASBIL logging the move as a resubmission of the query.
So for the discussions that follows, **"Repeat" refers to repeat queries combined with hub-and-spoke behaviour.**.

<!-- Keeping this in mind, we observed that the low group issued a significantly higher number of repeat queries (or hub-and-spoke moves), compared to the high group $(U = 51.5, n_{low}=7, n_{high}=8, p=.0077, CLES=0.92)$.
The highest differences occurred in the Outline phase and the Final paper phase (Figure ResP7955607431899741484), with the low group issuing double the number of repeat queries $(6.11 \pm 3.7)$ on average, w.r.t. the high group $(3.51 \pm 2.8)$  -->

<!-- When a user submits a search query that does not return satisfactory results, they may attempt to reformulate their query by using different keywords, rephrasing their question, or adding or removing search terms. Query reformulation can be done manually by the user or automatically by the search system using techniques such as query expansion or query suggestion. The goal of query reformulation is to help users find the information they are looking for more efficiently and effectively. -->


<!-- The low group issued more number of New Queries (sig diff), more query generalizations, more query specializations, and more repeat queries (sig diff), compared to the low group. The high group had had more word substitutions in their queries.  -->



The low group, in general issued more New queries, Generalizations, and Repeat queries (combined with hub-and-spoke moves) than the high group. 
On the other hand, the high group had more specializations and word substitutions in their queries than the low group.
The differences in Generalizations $(U = 218.0, p = .07, ES = 0.67)$
and Repeat queries $(U = 233.0, p = .05, ES = 0.69)$
were approaching statistical significance.
The trend in these reformulation counts across the semester are illustrated in Figures 

- ResP4758332161906858406 New
- ResP4519777880393782433 Generalization
- ResP8890916105505948535 Specialization
- ResP3490778183579127133 Word Substitution
- ResP6961499846675834400 Repeat


The low group had their highest counts of most query reformulation types while writing the final paper.
<!-- For the low group, all the highest counts of new queries, query generalizations, query specializations, and repeat queries occurred during the writing of the final paper.  -->
This suggests that students may have struggled to narrow down and refine their search queries when working on the final paper, perhaps due to the complexity and depth of the research required for this task.
The low group may have had more difficulty refining and targeting their search queries, resulting in more new and repeated queries as they searched for information. 
They may also have had more difficulty with the conceptualization of their research question or topic, leading to more generalizations and specializations in their queries. 



The high group, however, had a different pattern of query reformulation compared to the low group. 
They had their most count of new queries during the Outline phase, most generalizations in the Rough Draft Phase, and most specialization, word substitutions, and repeat queries while the Final Paper.
This indicates that their queries were more exploratory in the early part of the semester, and became more precise and refined in the later parts of the semester.
<!-- and query specializations , indicating that  -->
They may have been more proactive in identifying new avenues for research earlier in the semester. 
The highest count of query generalizations during the writing of the rough draft may suggest that they were better able to synthesize and generalize information from their sources at an earlier stage in the writing process. 
The high group may also have been better able to refine their search queries through word substitutions, which peaked while writing the final paper, indicating a greater level of precision and focus in their information seeking behaviour.
In contrast, the low group had their highest count of repeat queries during the outline and final paper, indicating that they may have had more difficulty finding and retaining relevant information throughout the research process.

<!-- also had their highest level of word subsitutions during the final paper writing phase. -->





<!-- The high group also showed a higher tendency towards query generalization and query specialization during the rough draft phase, while  -->

<!-- the high group tending to have more word substitutions and fewer repeat queries compared to the low group.  -->

<!-- The high group also showed a higher tendency towards query generalization and query specialization during the rough draft phase, while the low group had higher counts of all query reformulation types during the final paper phase. -->



<!-- 

Here are when the different query reformulation counts reached their maximum values during the semester, for the low and high groups:

Max values of query reformulation count for Low group:

- new queries: final paper
- query generalization: final paper
- query specialization: final paper
- word substitution: outline
- repeat queries: outline and final paper

Max values of query reformulation count for High group:

- new queries: outline and final paper
- query generalization: writing rough draft (after outline, before final paper)
- query specialization: outline
- word substitution: final paper
- repeat queries: rough draft 

-->


<!-- The low group issued more number of **New** queries in total (Figure ResN3873804091287075248) and on average (Figure ResP3026382842695489517), compared to the high group. 
During the Rough Draft and Final Paper phases, the low group exhibited heightened tendency to generate New search queries in their pursuit of novel information. 
On average, participants in the low group issued four more search queries than those in the HI group in these last two phases of the research project (Figure ResP3026382842695489517). 
This suggests that the LO group engaged in more active and extensive information-seeking behaviour, potentially reflecting a greater sense of urgency and pressure to complete their assignments.
The difference in total number of New queries between the groups approached significance $(U = 50.0, n_{low}=8, n_{high}=8, p=.06, CLES=0.78)$, with a moderately strong effect size. -->

<!-- The low group demonstrated a significantly higher count of total **Query Generalizations** $(U = 44.5, n_{low}=7, n_{high}=7, p=.01, CLES=0.91)$. 
While the high group issued a total of $2.57 \pm 2.1$ query generalizations per task the low group were issuing $9.86 \pm 6.7$ generalized queries for the same, across the entire study (Figure ResN3302769723271690264).
Query generalization is an indicative of exploratory behaviour, and this increase by the low group indicates a lack of specificity in the participants' information needs, which may lead to lower precision in search results. -->



<!-- The high group issued an average at least one word substitution for each search task.
The trend in the count of total **Query Specializations** was similar to that of Query Generalizations (Figure ResN6450294753032251158). 
The high group demonstrated the maximum number of query specialization before the Outline phase, whereas the low group did the same before the Final Paper phase.
While the difference was not significant, the effect size was moderately high $(U = 42.5, n_{low}=8, n_{high}=7, p=.10, CLES=0.76)$. -->


<!-- **Word Substitutions** were performed in all the tasks by the high group, whereas the low group skipped it during Proposal, and the `PHASE3-BIAS` task (Figure ResN3108315939720148502).  -->

### Entropy of Query Reformulation Types {#sec-res-query-H}

In the context of query reformulations, the maximum **transition entropy** $(s \log s)$ can be reached when there is an equal probability of switching between each of the $s = 5$ states, or QRTs (query reformulation types). 
The minimum transition entropy (0) is achieved in a fully deterministic Markov chain where all transition probabilities are either 1 or 0. 
This means that with a higher transition entropy there is more randomness in the participant's transitions between different QRTs. 
This randomness is an indication that the participants do not have a clear progression from one QRT to another. 
On the other hand, a lower transition entropy indicates that the participant's transition between QRTs are highly predictable.
**Stationary entropy** is calculated from the distribution of QRTs. 
A higher stationary entropy value indicates that the QRTs were used uniformly, while a lower stationary entropy indicates that some QRTs are preferred over others. 
Values of stationary entropy vary between 0 and $(\log s)$, where $s$ is the number of possible states (QRTs)^[The explanation is adapted from @he2016beyond].
All the entropy values were normalized by their theoretical maximums, for equivalent comparison across different tasks.


<!-- We computed the transition and stationary entropies of query reformulation types for  -->
<!-- the entire task duration, as well as for the beginning one-third, middle one-third, and end one-third of each task duration for each participant. -->

<!-- The results are discussed in the following sections. -->

<!-- A higher query reformulation entropy indicates a greater degree of uncertainty or randomness in the user's query reformulation behaviour, indicating that the user may be struggling to find relevant information or is uncertain about their information needs. In contrast, a lower query reformulation entropy suggests a more systematic and directed approach to search, indicating that the user has a clearer understanding of their information needs and is using query reformulation strategies to efficiently retrieve relevant information. Query reformulation entropy is a useful metric for evaluating the effectiveness of search systems and understanding user search behaviour.

Transition entropy is a metric that measures the uncertainty or randomness in the transitions between different search states, such as between queries, documents, or web pages. It quantifies the level of unpredictability or randomness in the user's navigation behavior as they move from one state to another, and can be used to evaluate the efficiency and effectiveness of search systems and interfaces.

Stationary entropy, on the other hand, measures the uncertainty or randomness in the distribution of user behavior within a single search state. For example, it can be used to analyze the frequency and distribution of query terms used by a user during a search session, or the distribution of clicks on search results pages. Stationary entropy provides insights into the structure and characteristics of user search behavior within a given context, and can be used to optimize search algorithms and ranking models. -->



<!-- 

the low group had the least randomness during outline, while the high group had the most during this stage. 
subsequently, the chaos in high group decreased, whereas that in low group increased


-->

The transition entropy of query reformulations followed interesting patterns for the low and high groups (Figure \@ref(fig:TODO)). 
The low group had a "V" pattern showing a decrease in transition entropy from proposal to outline, then an increase from outline to rough draft to final paper. 
On the other hand, the high group had a "ziag-zag" pattern with low transition entropy during the proposal, an increase during the outline, a decrease during the rough draft, and then another increase during the final paper. 
The difference was almost significant over the entire duration of the task $(U = 121, p = .054, ES = 0.32)$.
This indicates that the low group had the least randomness in query reformulation strategies during outline, while the high group had the most randomness at this stage. 
Subsequently, the randomness in the high group decreased, whereas that in low group increased.
This suggests that during the outline stage, the low group had a more structured approach to query reformulations, compared to the high group. 
However, as the semester progressed, the low group's approach became more random, while the high group's approach became structured. 
These pattern suggests that the low group may have struggled to adapt their query reformulation strategies as they moved through the different stages of writing the paper, while the high group was more able to adjust their strategies and maintain structure in their approach.
<!-- The high group may have had more efficient search strategies during the proposal and rough draft phases, but faced greater challenges during the outline and final paper phases, leading to more diverse query reformulation behaviours.  -->
<!-- The low group, however, may have had more consistent query reformulation behaviours throughout the different phases of the task, indicating less variability in their approach. -->




 <!-- differences were not significant over the entire duration of the tasks, there was a significant difference in the middle one-third interval of each task $(U = 131.0, p = .01, ES = 0.28)$.  -->

The stationary entropy of query reformulations of the low and high groups varied over the different phases of the research paper writing process as well (Figure \@ref(fig:TODO)). 
The low group's stationary entropy increased from the proposal phase to the rough draft phase, and then decreased to the Final Paper writing phase. 
The high group's stationary entropy increased from proposal to outline, and then took a decreasing trend from outline to rough draft to final paper. 
This indicates that these two groups had distinct information searching behaviours throughout the writing process $(U = 162, p = .06, ES = 0.72)$.
The low group's approach varied more depending on the stage of the writing process, and thus they employed all the different types query reformulations uniformly (i.e. with equal probabilities). 
The 

was trying out all the query reformulation types as the semester progressed, whereas the

maintained a more consistent approach to their information searching behaviour, and thus preferred some query reformulation types more over others.
The high group's 


The increase in the high group's stationary entropy from proposal to outline suggests that they were exploring a broader range of topics and concepts at the early stages of the writing process. 
The subsequent decrease in stationary entropy from outline to final paper suggests that they were able to narrow down their focus and consolidate their understanding of the subject-matter.










## L: Interaction with Search Results / Source Selection / Item Selection



### Number of Clicks per Query

ResN6629066624252186314 | ResP5466996162614873067 | ResP1250472196403953856

Number of clicks per query refers to the number of times a participant clicked a link on a search result page after conducting a search query. 
<!-- link during a single query session or search task. In other words, it represents the total number of times a participant clicked on any link on the search results page after conducting a search query.  -->
This metric reflects the level of interaction and engagement of the participant with the search results, as well as their ability to assess the relevance and usefulness of each search result presented to them.
<!-- This measure provides an indication of how much a participant engaged with the search results and how many different sources of information they explored while searching for relevant information.  -->
A higher number of clicks per query may indicate that the participant is more engaged and willing to explore a wider range of information sources, while a lower number may suggest a more focused and targeted search approach.



The high group had fewer total clicks per query (ResN6629066624252186314), and a lower average number of clicks per query (ResP5466996162614873067), compared to the low group, across most of the tasks during the semester.
The low group had the highest average number of clicks per query when writing the final paper, while the high group had the highest average number of clicks per query earlier in the semester, during the paper outline phase.
<!-- The low group had the maximum average clicks when writing the final paper, while the high group had the same earlier in the semester, during paper outline. -->
Additionally, the high group had lower variability (standard deviation) in the number of clicks per query compared to the low group $(U = 1235.0, p = .00, ES = 0.68)$.

This suggests that the high group was able to achieve better search outcomes with fewer clicks, indicating a higher level of efficiency in their search strategies. 
They may have been able to refine their search strategies and become more efficient as the semester progressed, resulting in fewer clicks per query when writing the final paper. 
This indicates the high group's ability to better assess the relevance and usefulness of search results, and to use their knowledge and cognitive strategies more effectively during the search process.
In contrast, the low group may have struggled to improve their search strategies, resulting in a higher number of clicks per query when writing the final paper.

It is also possible that the differences in average clicks per query between the two groups during different phases of the semester reflect differences in the complexity or specificity of the information needed for the different tasks. For example, the paper outline phase may have required more broad and exploratory searches, while the final paper phase may have required more targeted and specific searches.


<!-- 
The high group having higher motivation, metacognition and self-regulation had lesser number of clicks per query in total, and on average, compared to the low group, over almost all the tasks during the semester. 
The variability (standard deviation) of the number of clicks per query of the high group was also less than the low group. All the differences were statistically significant.


ResP878771263343515297
HI group was more efficient. Average number of clicks per query was lower (less than 4) as they moved forward in the semester, with highest in the Outline phase.

### Dwell Time on Search Results

<!-- As the final project task involved searching for 20 references, we structure the discussion around visits to "normal" webpages, and visits to "academic" webpages containing publications. -->

<!-- 

Count of search result pages can be inferred from count of queries. 
So it is better to focus on dwell time

-->


#### Publication Search Results

<!-- 

okay. now we move to describing dwell time on academic publication search results, such as on Google Scholar, digital libraries like ACM DL, Springer, Elsevier.

Low group had greater average dwell time on academic publication search results in all the four stages, viz. proposal, outline, rough draft, and final paper, compared to the high group.
Total dwell time of the low group was also higher, except at the final paper stage, when the high group surpassed the low group in dwelling on search results.



--->

ResP8346620135317238453 | ResN4762872426347949231

Contrary to dwell time on Web SERPs, the low group had longer average dwell time on academic publication search results, in all the four stages, compared to the high group (ResN4762872426347949231) $(U = 149.0, p = .05, ES = 0.72)$.
Total dwell time of the low group was also longer, except at the final paper stage, when the high group surpassed the low group in dwelling on publication search results.

This suggests that the low group spent more time examining and considering the academic publication search results compared to the high group. It is possible that the low group's lower levels of motivation, self-regulation, and metacognition may have led them to spend more time on search results as they may have found it harder to quickly evaluate and assess the relevance of search results to their task. On the other hand, the high group's higher levels of motivation, self-regulation, and metacognition may have enabled them to quickly identify relevant search results and move on to the next stage of their task. 
However, at the final paper stage, the high group spent more time on search results as they may have needed to ensure that they had not missed any important information and had thoroughly covered their topic. 

<!--

high group had longer dwell times on web search results and shorter dwell time on publication search results. low group had the opposite pattern.

-->




#### Web Search Results (SERPs)


<!-- 
Low group had lower values of motivation, self regulation and metacognition. High group had high values of those.
Across all the stages, Total Dwell Time (seconds) on Web SERPs was higher for the high group, and lower for the low group.
Average Dwell Time (seconds) on SERPs was higher for the high group, and lower for the low group.
Dwell time for high group decreased from proposal to outline, then increased from outline to rough draft, and then decreased during final paper.
Dwell time for low group decreased from proposal to outline; minimum during rough draft, and then increased again during final paper.

We examined how dwell time changed across the stages of the search process for each group. For the high group, dwell time decreased from proposal to outline, then increased from outline to rough draft, and then decreased again during the final paper stage. This suggests that participants in the high group spent less time on SERPs during the outline stage but spent more time during the rough draft stage. However, they spent less time again during the final paper stage.
For the low group, dwell time decreased from proposal to outline and then reached a minimum during the rough draft stage. However, it increased again during the final paper stage. This suggests that participants in the low group spent the least amount of time on SERPs during the outline and rough draft stages but spent more time during the final paper stage.

This indicates at the positive relationship between individual differences in motivation, self-regulation, and metacognition and the amount of time spent on SERPs during a search task. 

The high group's higher levels of motivation, self-regulation, and metacognition may have enabled them to engage in more effective and efficient search behaviours, leading to longer dwell times on SERPs. 
The higher dwell time on SERPs for the high group may indicate that they are more strategic and deliberate in their search behaviour, taking the time to carefully examine search results and evaluate their relevance to their information needs. This could be related to their higher levels of motivation, self-regulation, and metacognition, which enable them to set goals, monitor their progress, and adjust their strategies as needed to achieve optimal outcomes.

In contrast, the low group's lower levels of these individual differences may have hindered their ability to engage in effective search behaviours, leading to shorter dwell times on SERPs.
This suggests a more haphazard approach to search behaviour, with less attention to evaluating search results and less ability to regulate their search strategies. This may be related to their lower levels of motivation, self-regulation, and metacognition, which may limit their ability to set clear goals, monitor their progress, and make effective decisions in their search behaviour.




<!-- The high group was more efficient in their SERP examination, as they had lower total dwell times (Figure \@ref(fig:ResN7791839245731529625)) but higher average dwell times (ResP1938217350834571785) on SERPs compared to the low group. 
On the other hand, the low group had higher total dwell times, but a lower average dwell time on SERPs, which may indicate that they spent more time browsing through all the different SERPs, but spent less time on each individual SERP. 
The low group's dwell time pattern also showed a decrease in average dwell time during the outline stage, and stayed at the decreased value during rough draft stage, which could suggest that they struggled more with refining their search queries and examining search results during this stage.
The low group may have been more willing to spend time examining search results and exploring different options, while the high group may have been more efficient in quickly identifying and selecting relevant results.
The differences in total dwell time was significantly different in the beginning one-third $(U = 0.0, p = .02, ES = 0.00)$, middle one-third $(U = 16.0, p = .02, ES = 1.00)$, and end one-third $(U = 16.0, p = .02, ES = 1.00)$ portions of the tasks.  -->





In general, the high group had longer dwell times on web search results, and shorter dwell times on publication search results. The low group demonstrated the opposite pattern.
This is an interesting finding.
It suggests that the high group may be more efficient in quickly finding and evaluating information on the web, while the low group may take longer to navigate and process the same information. 
On the other hand, the low group may be more thorough in searching and evaluating academic publications (which was arguably one of the main aspects of writing the research paper), while the high group may be able to quickly identify and select relevant publications. 





## I: Interaction with Sources / Content Pages / Information Objects


<!-- 
now we move from discussing dwell time on search results to dwell time on content pages
 -->

### Academic Publications

<!-- 

Count

Low group viewed more number of academic publications earlier in the semester, while writing the outline, while high group viewed more number of publications later in the semester, while writing the rough draft and the final paper.

Dwell Time

The total and average dwell time (possibly reading time) also followed a similar pattern. The high group had longer dwell time on publications in total and on average, in the later parts of the semester, compared to the high group.

 -->

The low group viewed more number of academic publications earlier in the semester, while writing the outline, while high group viewed more number of publications later in the semester, while writing the rough draft and the final paper.
This indicates that the low group had a more exploratory approach towards their research earlier in the semester, as they spent more time looking through a larger number of academic publications while writing the outline. On the other hand, the high group had a more focused approach, spending more time on fewer publications during the later stages when writing the rough draft and the final paper.
This may be an indication of a difference in information-seeking behaviour and strategies between the two groups, with the low group possibly using a more broad and inclusive approach to gather information, while the high group uses a more selective approach. It could also reflect differences in the stage of research and writing that the two groups were at during each stage, with the low group at a more exploratory stage earlier in the semester, while the high group was at a more advanced stage of writing.


The total and average dwell time (possibly reading time) also followed a similar pattern. 
The high group had longer dwell time on publications in total and on average, in the later parts of the semester, while the low group dwelt more on publications in the earlier parts of the semester.
This suggests that the high group had a more focused and deliberate approach to their research process, possibly due to better metacognitive and self-regulation skills. They spent more time on each publication, reading and analysing it thoroughly, in the later parts of the semester when they were working on the rough draft and final paper. This behaviour could have led to a deeper understanding of the content and better integration of the information into their writing. On the other hand, the low group may have had a more scattered approach, possibly due to lower levels of motivation, self-regulation, and metacognitive awareness, resulting in spending less time on each publication and viewing a larger number of publications earlier in the semester. 
This behaviour could have resulted in a superficial understanding of the content and difficulties in integrating the information into their writing.



### Non-scholarly / Normal Content pages

<!-- 

Count


Low group visited more number of content pages that were not academic publications compared to the high group.
Their total dwell time on such pages were high, but the average dwell time was low.


Dwell Time

the task that they were doing was to write a research paper at least twenty external sources

 -->

In a similar vein to publication vs web search results, the low group visited more number of content pages that were not academic publications compared to the high group.
Their total dwell time on such pages were also longer than the high group, but the average dwell time was shorter.
This suggests that the low group engaged in more exploratory behaviour, perhaps looking for additional sources of information or inspiration, beyond the academic publications. 
However, their lower average dwell time on these pages indicates that they may have been quickly scanning or skimming through the content, rather than engaging with it in depth. 
It's possible that they were spending less time on average on these pages because they were not as relevant or useful for their research paper.


On the other hand, the high group may have been more focused on finding academic sources for their paper, which could explain their lower number of visits to non-academic content pages.
They may have been more focused on the task at hand and less likely to be distracted by extraneous information. 
The longer average dwell time on content pages suggests that they were more deeply engaging with the material they did visit. 
Overall, the low group may have been more inclined to explore a broader range of information sources, while the high group was more focused on academic sources and more likely to engage deeply with the content they did view.



## Entropy of Search Tactic Sequences

Similar to entropy analysis of Query Reformulation types (Section \@ref(sec-res-query-H)), we perform entropy analysis of search tactic transitions.
This analysis is directly inspired from @he2016beyond, who in turn were inspired from [@krejtz2014entropy, @krejtz2015gaze].

In the context of search tactic transitions, a higher value of transition entropy ($H_t$) indicates more randomness and uncertainty in the participant's search behaviour (which is composed of different search tactics, and transitioning or switching between those tactics).
<!-- in transitions between different search tactics, and consequently in search behaviour. -->
A lower value of transition entropy indicates that the search behaviour (i.e. tactic switching behaviour) is highly predictable.
For stationary entropy of search tactics ($H_s$), a higher value indicates that participants utilize all the search tactics with equal probability, while a lower value suggests that certain search tactics are favoured over others.
<!-- all search tactics are used uniformly, whereas a lower value indicates that some search tactics are more preferred over others. -->
The entropies discussed in the following sections were normalized by their theoretical maximums, for equivalent comparison across different conditions.


<!-- ### Transition Entropy of Search Tactics -->

ResN7289045485214067875 
Both groups had highest Ht during 2C (and also 3 Finance?)

No sig diff for whole task, and at the beginning of task
Sig diff appeared at the middle and increased at the end of task (similar to as observed by Gwizdka).


<!-- ### Stationary Entropy of Search Tactics -->

ResP8685879301269737254
LO group had hghest Hs in 2C
No sig diff in overall task

No diff at beginning.
Diff is most prominent at middle (ResN1140102300744288543)
and also somewhat at end (ResN663758335140886910)







## Search Result Pages vs Content Pages



<!-- High group visited more search result pages and more content pages as the semester progressed, while we see a drop for the same for the low group, especially after the outline phase, while writing rough draft.
Then there is again an increase in the number of pages visited by the low group while writing the final paper.
The total dwell time on webpages also follow a similar pattern. -->


Overall, the high group visited more search result pages and content pages as the semester progressed, while the low group had a drop in these behaviours after the outline phase. 
The difference in visits to Search Results pages was almost significant $(U = 133.5, p = .06, ES = 0.33)$.
This suggests that the high group may have been more engaged and persistent in their information searching behaviours, while the low group may have experienced a decrease in motivation or self-regulation as the semester progressed, specifically before writing the rough draft.

It is also noteworthy that the low group had a rebound in the number of pages visited while writing the final paper. This could indicate that they were able to re-engage with the task and their information searching behaviours improved as the final-paper deadline approached.

The fact that the total dwell time on webpages followed a similar pattern as the number of pages visited is also interesting. It suggests that the high group spent more time engaging with the content they found, which could have contributed to their better learning outcomes.

 --------------- context: ------------

For my PhD dissertation I conducted a longitudinal study of information searching beaviours of undergraduate university students vis a vis their learning outcomes while writing a research paper.
Participants were grouped into high and low groups using Latent Profile Analysis, from self-reported scores on motivation, metacognition, and self-regulation.
The task that they were doing was to write a research paper citing at least twenty external sources.
The writing involved four stages spread across the semester: proposal, outline, rough draft, and final paper.
Let us discuss some of the findings.

<result>
Why?
--------------- context: ------------



Listed below are one line results for all the computed measures of my study.
Analyse them and help me write the results chapter of my dissertation.


Overall, the high group demonstrated higher levels of engagement with search results, with a higher total number and average number of clicks per query, and a higher variability of clicks per query. However, there were no significant differences between the groups in terms of the number, total length, average length, or variability of query length, or in terms of the transition entropy of query reformulations for the entire task. These findings suggest that engagement with search results may be an important factor in the success of undergraduate students in writing research papers.
