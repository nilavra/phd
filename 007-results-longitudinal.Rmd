# Results from `PHASE2`: Longitudinal Searching for Writing Research Paper



As the sample sizes were often small, and / or did not match the normality assumptions of parametric tests, we have employed the non-parametric Mann-Whitney U test for all the null-hypothesis testing. This allows easy comparison between different categories of results.



Additionally, we also report Common Language Effect Size (CLES) for each statistical test result.
The common language effect size is the proportion of pairs where $x$ is higher than $y$. 
In other words, it is the probability that a score sampled at random from one distribution will be greater than a score sampled from some other distribution. 
CLES was first introduced by McGraw and Wong (1992) [TODO]. The Python statistical library employed in data analysis -- Pingouin [@vallat2018pingouin] -- uses a brute-force version of the formula given by Vargha and Delaney 2000 [TODO]:
The advantage is of this method are twofold. First, the brute-force approach pairs each observation of x to its y counterpart, and therefore does not require normally distributed data. Second, the formula takes ties into account and therefore works with ordinal data.

In the interest of better presentation and readability of this chapter, more ancillary plots are presented in Appendices \@ref(app-plots-query) and \@ref(app-plots-search).

We employed Latent Profile Analysis (LPA) to identify groups (latent profiles) of participants based on their scores on the Intrinsic Motivation Inventory (IMI), Metacognitive Awareness Inventory (MAI), and Self-regulation questionnaire (SRQ).
<!-- We employed To classify participants into high and low groups based on their self-reported scores on these questionnaires, we employed LPA.  -->
LPA is particularly useful when the relationship between variables is not well understood, or when it is difficult to determine which variables should be used to classify individuals into groups.


The results of the LPA showed that there were two distinct latent profiles of participants based on their scores on the IMI, MAI, and SRQ: a high group and a low group (Figure \@ref(fig:lpa-profile-model-57)). The high group had generally higher scores on the IMI, MAI, and SRQ compared to the low group, indicating that they were more intrinsically motivated, more aware of their metacognitive processes, and had higher levels of self-regulation.

## Q: Query Formulations


### Length of Queries

Query length was operationalized as the number of terms (words separated by spaces) in the search query that participants submitted to the search engines or other information retrieval sites.
Query length can vary from a single word to several phrases or a full sentence. 
<!-- Search engines use algorithms to analyze search query length and interpret the intent of the user's search in order to provide the most relevant search results.  -->
Longer search queries may indicate a more specific or complex information need, while shorter search queries may be more general or broad in scope.
<!-- The number of terms in each query was aggregated over each participant-task pair, to obtain total, average, and standard deviation (variability) of query length. -->

The average length of queries issued by the high group were always longer than those issued by the low group, except before the Outline (`PHASE2B`) and the Final Paper submission (`PHASE2D`) (Figure \@ref(fig:ResP2136245316506143308)).
<!-- For all tasks,  the high group issued longer queries than the low group (Figure ResP4090733126835336320),  -->
The low group, with lower levels of motivation, metacognition, and self-regulation, were issuing queries which were often two terms (words) shorter on average, than the corresponding queries from the high group.

The total query length for the low group increased monotonically over the semester during `PHASE2` (Figure \@ref(fig:ResP7744164942895533217)), with the longest queries being issued by this group before the Final Paper submission phase (`PHASE2D`).
On the other hand, queries from the high group were the longest during the Outline phase (`PHASE2B`), and then it decreased in the subsequent phases.
This indicates that the high group, with higher levels of motivation, metacognition, and self-regulation, were planning ahead in the early parts of the semester to find their references. 
On the other hand, the low group, with lower levels of those traits, demonstrated a tendency to procrastinate and delay their work until the final paper.
A quote from participant `P006_HANOI` illustrates this phenomenon:

> *"so far for this rough draft I haven't actually had to google anything since I downloaded everything into pdfs during the outline stage and haven't needed any new material so far."*
>
> `r nbQuoteAuthor("--- P006_HANOI")`
>

<!-- 
LO group had highest total query length before final paper (ResN5894660104957913932)


HI group had highest average query length during rough draft (ResP6726131652814458688)

LO group was slacking and putting it off till last minute.

 -->



  

### Number of Queries per Search Task

Number of queries per search task refers to the number of separate queries or search attempts that a participant issued in order to complete a task. 
<!-- having the same information need. -->
<!-- single information-seeking task on a search engine or other information retrieval system. A search task is typically defined as a specific information need or question that the user is attempting to answer through a series of search queries.  -->
This measure may vary depending on the complexity of the information need, the user's level of expertise with the search system, and other factors. 
<!-- This metric is commonly used in information retrieval research to evaluate the effectiveness of search systems and user search behavior. -->

The number of queries issued per task (Figure \@ref(fig:ResN5999530166888685231)) followed a similar pattern as the total query length (Figure \@ref(fig:ResP7744164942895533217)).
The low group issued a steadily increasing number of queries as they progressed through the semester, from the Proposal to the Final Paper phase, overtaking the high group at the Outline phase.
In contrast, the high group decreased their query submissions after the Outline phase, signifying they may have already collected the information they need in the earlier parts of the semester.
<!-- issued higher number of queries during the early part of the semester -- Proposal and Outline -- but then they issued lower number of queries during the later parts of the semester, w.r.t. the high group.  -->
The difference in the number of queries issued by the two groups approached statistical significance according to a two-tailed Mann-Whitney U test $(U = 1021.5, p = .09, ES = 0.61)$, with a moderate effect size.

<!-- were the highest before the Rough Draft (`PHASE2C`) . -->


<!-- Like avg query length, LO group issued highest number of queries when writing final paper, while HI roup did that during outline.
Even, one participant commendted "I had downloaded all the papers I needed during..." -->








### Query Reformulation Types (QRTs)

Query reformulation refers to the process of modifying or refining a search query in order to improve the relevance of search results and better match the user's information needs (Section \@ref(sec-bg-search-query)). 
Query reformulation typically occurs due to a searcher's improved understanding of how to better translate their information need into a search query.
Using the taxonomy proposed by @liu2010analysis (Figure \@ref(fig:res-Q-QRT-txnmy)), we classified each previous-next query pair issued by participants into one of the five query reformulation types (QRTs):
New,
Generalization,
Specialization,
Word Substitution,
and 
Repeat.

We faced a challenge in disentangling **Repeat** queries from "hub-and-spoke" behaviour, where the user goes back and forth between the SERP and a content page by using the browser's forward and back buttons ^[The SERP is the hub, which represents the initial point of inquiry, while the spokes represent the subsequent branches of exploration along different content pages. This search behaviour is often used when users have a general idea of the topic they are interested in, but need to explore different facets of the topic to narrow down their search and find relevant information.].
Each back button press on the browser (to go back to the SERP from a content page) meant a fresh HTTP GET request was sent to the search engine. 
This resulted in YASBIL logging the move as a resubmission of the query.
So for the discussions that follows, **"Repeat" refers to repeat queries combined with hub-and-spoke behaviour.**.

<!-- Keeping this in mind, we observed that the low group issued a significantly higher number of repeat queries (or hub-and-spoke moves), compared to the high group $(U = 51.5, n_{low}=7, n_{high}=8, p=.0077, CLES=0.92)$.
The highest differences occurred in the Outline phase and the Final paper phase (Figure ResP7955607431899741484), with the low group issuing double the number of repeat queries $(6.11 \pm 3.7)$ on average, w.r.t. the high group $(3.51 \pm 2.8)$  -->

<!-- When a user submits a search query that does not return satisfactory results, they may attempt to reformulate their query by using different keywords, rephrasing their question, or adding or removing search terms. Query reformulation can be done manually by the user or automatically by the search system using techniques such as query expansion or query suggestion. The goal of query reformulation is to help users find the information they are looking for more efficiently and effectively. -->


<!-- The low group issued more number of New Queries (sig diff), more query generalizations, more query specializations, and more repeat queries (sig diff), compared to the low group. The high group had had more word substitutions in their queries.  -->



The low group issued more New queries, Generalizations, Specializations, and Repeat queries (combined with hub-and-spoke moves) than the high group. 
On the other hand, the high group had more word substitutions in their queries than the low group.
The differences in New queries $(U = 1066.0, p = .03, ES = 0.63)$
and Repeat queries $(U = 1094.5, p = .03, ES = 0.63)$
were statistically significant.
The trend in these reformulation counts across the semester are illustrated in Figures 

- ResP4286504130058349795 New
- ResN1744315778481681652 Generalization
- ResP2653175457120298457 Specialization
- ResN2468268136429851311 Word Substitution
- ResP5924714325943281540 Repeat


The low group had their highest counts of all query reformulation types (barring Repeat) while writing the final paper.
<!-- For the low group, all the highest counts of new queries, query generalizations, query specializations, and repeat queries occurred during the writing of the final paper.  -->
This suggests that students may have struggled to narrow down and refine their search queries when working on the final paper, perhaps due to the complexity and depth of the research required for this task.
The low group may have had more difficulty refining and targeting their search queries, resulting in more new and repeated queries as they searched for information. 
They may also have had more difficulty with the conceptualization of their research question or topic, leading to more generalizations and specializations in their queries. 



The high group, however, had a different pattern of query reformulation compared to the low group. 
They had their highest count of new queries and query specializations during the outline phase, indicating that they may have been more proactive in identifying new avenues for research earlier in the semester. 
They also had their highest count of query generalizations during the writing of the rough draft, which may suggest that they were better able to synthesize and generalize information from their sources at an earlier stage in the writing process. 
The high group may also have been better able to refine their search queries through word substitutions, which peaked while writing the final paper, indicating a greater level of precision and focus in their information seeking behaviour.
In contrast, the low group had their highest count of repeat queries during the outline and final paper, indicating that they may have had more difficulty finding and retaining relevant information throughout the research process.

<!-- also had their highest level of word subsitutions during the final paper writing phase. -->





<!-- The high group also showed a higher tendency towards query generalization and query specialization during the rough draft phase, while  -->

<!-- the high group tending to have more word substitutions and fewer repeat queries compared to the low group.  -->

<!-- The high group also showed a higher tendency towards query generalization and query specialization during the rough draft phase, while the low group had higher counts of all query reformulation types during the final paper phase. -->



<!-- 

Here are when the different query reformulation counts reached their maximum values during the semester, for the low and high groups:

Max values of query reformulation count for Low group:

- new queries: final paper
- query generalization: final paper
- query specialization: final paper
- word substitution: outline
- repeat queries: outline and final paper

Max values of query reformulation count for High group:

- new queries: outline and final paper
- query generalization: writing rough draft (after outline, before final paper)
- query specialization: outline
- word substitution: final paper
- repeat queries: rough draft 

-->


<!-- The low group issued more number of **New** queries in total (Figure ResN3873804091287075248) and on average (Figure ResP3026382842695489517), compared to the high group. 
During the Rough Draft and Final Paper phases, the low group exhibited heightened tendency to generate New search queries in their pursuit of novel information. 
On average, participants in the low group issued four more search queries than those in the HI group in these last two phases of the research project (Figure ResP3026382842695489517). 
This suggests that the LO group engaged in more active and extensive information-seeking behaviour, potentially reflecting a greater sense of urgency and pressure to complete their assignments.
The difference in total number of New queries between the groups approached significance $(U = 50.0, n_{low}=8, n_{high}=8, p=.06, CLES=0.78)$, with a moderately strong effect size. -->


<!-- ResN8316003849035045794 
no. of new queries was the highest during final paper for the LO group

<!-- The low group demonstrated a significantly higher count of total **Query Generalizations** $(U = 44.5, n_{low}=7, n_{high}=7, p=.01, CLES=0.91)$. 
While the high group issued a total of $2.57 \pm 2.1$ query generalizations per task the low group were issuing $9.86 \pm 6.7$ generalized queries for the same, across the entire study (Figure ResN3302769723271690264).
Query generalization is an indicative of exploratory behaviour, and this increase by the low group indicates a lack of specificity in the participants' information needs, which may lead to lower precision in search results. -->



<!-- The high group issued an average at least one word substitution for each search task.
The trend in the count of total **Query Specializations** was similar to that of Query Generalizations (Figure ResN6450294753032251158). 
The high group demonstrated the maximum number of query specialization before the Outline phase, whereas the low group did the same before the Final Paper phase.
While the difference was not significant, the effect size was moderately high $(U = 42.5, n_{low}=8, n_{high}=7, p=.10, CLES=0.76)$. -->


<!-- **Word Substitutions** were performed in all the tasks by the high group, whereas the low group skipped it during Proposal, and the `PHASE3-BIAS` task (Figure ResN3108315939720148502).  -->

## L: Interaction with Search Results / Source Selection / Item Selection



### Number of Clicks per Query

Number of clicks per query refers to the number of times a participant clicked a link on a search result page after conducting a search query. 
<!-- link during a single query session or search task. In other words, it represents the total number of times a participant clicked on any link on the search results page after conducting a search query.  -->
This metric reflects the level of interaction and engagement of the participant with the search results, as well as their ability to assess the relevance and usefulness of each search result presented to them.
<!-- This measure provides an indication of how much a participant engaged with the search results and how many different sources of information they explored while searching for relevant information.  -->
A higher number of clicks per query may indicate that the participant is more engaged and willing to explore a wider range of information sources, while a lower number may suggest a more focused and targeted search approach.

The high group had fewer total clicks per query $(U = 1069.5, p = .03, ES = 0.64)$, and a lower average number of clicks per query $(U = 1194.0, p = .01, ES = 0.65)$, compared to the low group, across most of the tasks during the semester (Figure \@ref(fig:ResP6921334635387427729)).
The low group had the highest average number of clicks per query when writing the final paper, while the high group had the highest average number of clicks per query earlier in the semester, during the paper outline phase.
<!-- The low group had the maximum average clicks when writing the final paper, while the high group had the same earlier in the semester, during paper outline. -->
Additionally, the high group had lower variability (standard deviation) in the number of clicks per query compared to the low group $(U = 1235.0, p = .00, ES = 0.68)$, and all of these differences were statistically significant.

This suggests that the high group was able to achieve better search outcomes with fewer clicks, indicating a higher level of efficiency in their search strategies. 
They may have been able to refine their search strategies and become more efficient as the semester progressed, resulting in fewer clicks per query when writing the final paper. 
This indicates the high group's ability to better assess the relevance and usefulness of search results, and to use their knowledge and cognitive strategies more effectively during the search process.
In contrast, the low group may have struggled to improve their search strategies, resulting in a higher number of clicks per query when writing the final paper.

It is also possible that the differences in average clicks per query between the two groups during different phases of the semester reflect differences in the complexity or specificity of the information needed for the different tasks. For example, the paper outline phase may have required more broad and exploratory searches, while the final paper phase may have required more targeted and specific searches.


<!-- 
The high group having higher motivation, metacognition and self-regulation had lesser number of clicks per query in total, and on average, compared to the low group, over almost all the tasks during the semester. 
The variability (standard deviation) of the number of clicks per query of the high group was also less than the low group. All the differences were statistically significant.


ResP878771263343515297
HI group was more efficient. Average number of clicks per query was lower (less than 4) as they moved forward in the semester, with highest in the Outline phase.

### Dwell Time on Search Results Pages

<!-- As the final project task involved searching for 20 references, we structure the discussion around visits to "normal" webpages, and visits to "academic" webpages containing publications. -->

<!-- 

Count of search result pages can be inferred from count of queries. 
So it is better to focus on dwell time

-->

#### Web Search Results (SERPs)


<!-- Across all the stages, Total Dwell Time (seconds) on SERPs was lower for the high group, and higher for the low group.
Across all the stages, Average Dwell Time (seconds) on SERPs was higher for the high group, and lower for the low group.
Dwell time for the high group decreased from avg 30 seconds during proposal to ~ 10 seconds during outline, then again increased to ~ 30 seconds during rough draft, and then decreased to 20 seconds during final paper.
Average dwell time for low group decreased from 20 seconds at proposal to less than 10 seconds during outline, stayed the same at rough draft, and then increased to 20 seconds during final paper. -->


The high group was more efficient in their SERP examination, as they had lower total dwell times (Figure \@ref(fig:ResN7791839245731529625)) but higher average dwell times (ResP1938217350834571785) on SERPs compared to the low group. 
<!-- The high group also had a more consistent pattern of dwell time across the stages, with a peak at the rough draft stage. -->
On the other hand, the low group had higher total dwell times, but a lower average dwell time on SERPs, which may indicate that they spent more time browsing through all the different SERPs, but spent less time on each individual SERP. 
The low group's dwell time pattern also showed a decrease in average dwell time during the outline stage,, and stayed at the decreased value during rough draft stage, which could suggest that they struggled more with refining their search queries and examining search results during this stage.
The low group may have been more willing to spend time examining search results and exploring different options, while the high group may have been more efficient in quickly identifying and selecting relevant results.
The differences in total dwell time was significantly different in the beginning one-third $(U = 0.0, p = .02, ES = 0.00)$, middle one-third $(U = 16.0, p = .02, ES = 1.00)$, and end one-third $(U = 16.0, p = .02, ES = 1.00)$ portions of the tasks.

## Entropy Analyses of Sequences

### Query Reformulation Sequences {#sec-res-query-H}

Entropy is a measure of the diversity or unpredictability of a sequence of events. In the context of search queries, entropy can be used to quantify the variability or randomness of the query reformulations issued by participants.
Transition analysis and entropy helps to cover differences in disparate tasks and activities.
Inspired by previous works in analysing eye-movement sequences [@krejtz2014entropy; @krejtz2015gaze] and search tactics sequences [@he2016beyond], we employed a similar entropy analysis of query reformulation sequences issued by users.


If we consider the sequence of query reformulations issued by a participant 
(e.g., *New -> New -> Specialization -> Specialization -> Word Substitution -> Generalization*)
then this sequence can be considered as a first order Markov chain, wherein, the next step in the chain depends only on the current state.
Entropy analysis on these Markov chains quantifies how predictable the states are, and yields two categories of uncertainty measures: transition entropy, $H_t$, and stationary entropy $H_s$.


In the context of query reformulations, the maximum **transition entropy** $(s \log s)$ can be reached when there is an equal probability of switching between each of the $s = 5$ states, or QRTs (query reformulation types). 
The minimum transition entropy (0) is achieved in a fully deterministic Markov chain where all transition probabilities are either 1 or 0. 
This means that with a higher transition entropy there is more randomness in the participant's transitions between different QRTs. 
This randomness is an indication that the participants do not have a clear progression from one QRT to another. 
On the other hand, a lower transition entropy indicates that the participant's transition between QRTs are highly predictable.
**Stationary entropy** is calculated from the distribution of QRTs. 
A higher stationary entropy value indicates that the QRTs were used uniformly, while a lower stationary entropy indicates that some QRTs are preferred over others. 
Values of stationary entropy vary between 0 and $(\log s)$, where $s$ is the number of possible states (QRTs)^[The explanation is adapted from @he2016beyond].


We computed the transition and stationary entropies of query reformulation types for 
the entire task duration, as well as for the beginning one-third, middle one-third, and end one-third of each task duration for each participant.
All the entropy values were normalized by their theoretical maximums, for equivalent comparison across different tasks.
<!-- The results are discussed in the following sections. -->

<!-- A higher query reformulation entropy indicates a greater degree of uncertainty or randomness in the user's query reformulation behaviour, indicating that the user may be struggling to find relevant information or is uncertain about their information needs. In contrast, a lower query reformulation entropy suggests a more systematic and directed approach to search, indicating that the user has a clearer understanding of their information needs and is using query reformulation strategies to efficiently retrieve relevant information. Query reformulation entropy is a useful metric for evaluating the effectiveness of search systems and understanding user search behaviour.

Transition entropy is a metric that measures the uncertainty or randomness in the transitions between different search states, such as between queries, documents, or web pages. It quantifies the level of unpredictability or randomness in the user's navigation behavior as they move from one state to another, and can be used to evaluate the efficiency and effectiveness of search systems and interfaces.

Stationary entropy, on the other hand, measures the uncertainty or randomness in the distribution of user behavior within a single search state. For example, it can be used to analyze the frequency and distribution of query terms used by a user during a search session, or the distribution of clicks on search results pages. Stationary entropy provides insights into the structure and characteristics of user search behavior within a given context, and can be used to optimize search algorithms and ranking models. -->



<!-- 
Transition Entropy of low group decreased from proposal to outline, then increased from outline to rough draft, and from rough draft to final paper.
Transition entropy of the high group was the lowest during proposal, then increased slightly during outline, then again decreased during rough draft, and then increased to maximum during final paper.
The differences were not significant over the entire duration of the tasks, but when we look at the middle one-third interval of each task, then there is a significant difference in the transition entropy of the low and high groups.


the low group had the least randomness during outline, while the high group had the most during this stage. 
subsequently, the chaos in high group decreased, whereas that in low group increased


Stationary entropy of low group remained almost at the same value throughout: very little increase from proposal to outline to rough draft, and then a slight decrease to final paper.
Stationary Entropy of high group increased a lot from proposal to outline, then increased slightly  from outline to rough draft, and then decreased a lot (below low group) from rough draft to final paper.
The differences were not significant over the entire duration of the tasks, but when we look at the beginning one-third and the middle one-third interval of each task, then there is a significant difference in the stationary entropy of the low and high groups.

-->

The transition entropy of query reformulations showed interesting patterns between the low and high groups (Figure \@ref(fig:ResP2794594806936084269)). 
While the differences were not significant over the entire duration of the tasks, there was a significant difference in the middle one-third interval of each task $(U = 131.0, p = .01, ES = 0.28)$. 
The low group showed a decrease in transition entropy from proposal to outline, then an increase from outline to rough draft, and finally, from rough draft to final paper. 
On the other hand, the high group had the lowest transition entropy during the proposal, followed by a slight increase during the outline, another decrease during the rough draft, and then a maximum during the final paper. 


The low group had the least randomness (transition entropy) during outline, while the high group had the most randomness at this stage. 
Subsequently, the randomness in the high group decreased, whereas that in low group increased (Figure \@ref(fig:ResP2794594806936084269)).
This suggests that during the outline stage, the low group had a more structured approach to query reformulations, compared to the high group. 
However, as the semester progressed, the low group's approach became more random, while the high group's approach became more structured. 
These results indicate that the low group may have struggled to adapt their query reformulation strategies as they moved through the different stages of writing the paper, while the high group was more able to adjust their strategies and maintain structure in their approach.
<!-- The high group may have had more efficient search strategies during the proposal and rough draft phases, but faced greater challenges during the outline and final paper phases, leading to more diverse query reformulation behaviours.  -->
<!-- The low group, however, may have had more consistent query reformulation behaviours throughout the different phases of the task, indicating less variability in their approach. -->


The stationary entropy of query reformulations of the low and high groups varied over the different phases of the research paper writing process (Figure \@ref(fig:ResP5913968108765420078)). The low group's stationary entropy remained almost stable throughout, while the high group's stationary entropy increased from proposal to outline and then decreased from rough draft to final paper. The differences were approaching significance for the entire task duration $(U = 721.5, p = .09, ES = 0.40)$, and were significant near the beginning of the task $(U = 472.0, p = .009, ES = 0.32)$, and during the middle of the tasks $(U = 148.0, p = .01, ES = 0.28)$.


Overall, the differences in entropies between the low and high groups indicate that these two groups had distinct information searching behaviours throughout the writing process.
The low group maintained a more consistent approach to their information searching behaviour, and thus preferred some query reformulation types more over others.
The high group's approach varied more depending on the stage of the writing process, and thus employing all the different types query reformulations uniformly (i.e. with equal probabilities). 
The increase in the high group's stationary entropy from proposal to outline suggests that they were exploring a broader range of topics and concepts at the early stages of the writing process. 
The subsequent decrease in stationary entropy from rough draft to final paper suggests that they were able to narrow down their focus and consolidate their understanding of the subject-matter.

### Search Tactic Sequences

Similar to entropy analysis of Query Reformulation types (Section \@ref(sec-res-query-H)), we perform entropy analysis of search tactic transitions.
This analysis is directly inspired from @he2016beyond, who in turn were inspired from [@krejtz2014entropy, @krejtz2015gaze].

In the context of search tactic transitions, a higher value of transition entropy ($H_t$) indicates more randomness and uncertainty in the participant's search behaviour (which is composed of different search tactics, and transitioning or switching between those tactics).
<!-- in transitions between different search tactics, and consequently in search behaviour. -->
A lower value of transition entropy indicates that the search behaviour (i.e. tactic switching behaviour) is highly predictable.
For stationary entropy of search tactics ($H_s$), a higher value indicates that participants utilize all the search tactics with equal probability, while a lower value suggests that certain search tactics are favoured over others.
<!-- all search tactics are used uniformly, whereas a lower value indicates that some search tactics are more preferred over others. -->
The entropies discussed in the following sections were normalized by their theoretical maximums, for equivalent comparison across different conditions.

For my PhD dissertation I conducted a longitudinal study of information searching beaviours of undergraduate university students vis a vis their learning outcomes while writing a research paper.
The study had 3 phases of data collection: an initial phase at the beginning of the semester, a longitudinal tracking phase during the 16 weeks of the semester, and a final phase at the end of the semester.
Participants were grouped into high and low groups using Latent Profile Analysis based on self-reported values on motivation, metacognition, and self-regulation.
Listed below are one line results for all the computed measures of my study.
Analyse them and help me write the results chapter of my dissertation.


Overall, the high group demonstrated higher levels of engagement with search results, with a higher total number and average number of clicks per query, and a higher variability of clicks per query. However, there were no significant differences between the groups in terms of the number, total length, average length, or variability of query length, or in terms of the transition entropy of query reformulations for the entire task. These findings suggest that engagement with search results may be an important factor in the success of undergraduate students in writing research papers.
