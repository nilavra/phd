<!-- We propose to conduct a remote longitudinal study to investigate the
research questions and hypotheses discussed in Section
[\[sec-rq\]](#sec-rq){reference-type="ref" reference="sec-rq"}. The
study will primarily be exploratory in nature. The following sections

## Study Design {#sec-method-exp-design}

![ Final project description, setting up the search tasks throughout the
semester.
](figs/final-project-description.pdf){#fig-final-project-description
width="\\linewidth"}

The remote longitudinal study is planned to span over the course of a
typical university semester (approximately 16 weeks). Participants will
be recruited from a course (study site) at the University of Texas at
Austin (UT Austin). The ideal study site will be a final-project based
course, where the final-project report (artefact, Section
[\[sec-bg-learn-artefact\]](#sec-bg-learn-artefact){reference-type="ref"
reference="sec-bg-learn-artefact"}) will be built over time throughout
the semester, with periodic check-ins. Completing the final project will
require searching and navigating information online, finding relevant
sources for a set of assigned or self-chosen topics, and weaving a
narration around the information found in the selected sources.

The study design was informed by running a pilot study during Summer
2021 semester, in partnership with two courses at UT Austin School of
Information: *Information in Cyberspace*, and *Academic Success in the
Digital University*. More details of the pilot study are presented in
Appendix [\[ch-pilot-study\]](#ch-pilot-study){reference-type="ref"
reference="ch-pilot-study"}. The final project overview from the
*Information in Cyberspace* course is presented in Figure
[1.1](#fig-final-project-description){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig-final-project-description"}. The words or phrases
enclosed in \[\[square brackets\]\] will be appropriately modified when
the study site is finalised. We aim to recruit upwards of 30
participants. Since the study is exploratory in nature, and is intended
to inform future confirmatory studies, we are unable to conduct a power
analysis.

## Apparatus

### YASBIL Browsing Logger

The YASBIL browsing logger [@bhattacharya2021yasbil] will be utilised
for this study. YASBIL (Yet Another Search Behaviour and Interaction
Logger) is a two-component logging solution for ethically recording a
user's browsing activity for Interactive IR user studies. It was
developed by the author in early Spring 2021, and was employed in the
pilot study for data collection and testing. YASBIL comprises a Firefox
browser extension and a WordPress plugin. The browser extension logs the
browsing activity in the participants' machines. The WordPress plugin
collects the logged data into the researcher's data server. YASBIL
captures participant's behavioural data, such as webpage visits, time
spent on pages, identification of popular search engines and their
SERPs, identifying rank of result clicked on SERPs, tracking mouse
clicks and scrolls, and the order and sequences of this events. The
logging works on any webpage, without the need to own or have knowledge
about the HTML structure of the webpage. To protect the privacy of
participants, the logger software can be switched on or off, and
participants will be instructed (and encouraged) to switch on the logger
only when they are performing search activities related to the
experiment. YASBIL also offers ethical data transparency and security
towards participants, by enabling them to view and obtain copies of the
logged data, as well as securely upload the data to the researcher's
server over an HTTPS connection. Although developed using the
cross-browser WebExtension API [@url-cross-browser-extn], YASBIL
currently works in the Firefox Web Browser. So participants will be
instructed to install Firefox and YASBIL on their machines if they
choose to participate in the study.

### Online Concept Mapping Software

As discussed in Section
[\[sec-bg-concept-maps\]](#sec-bg-concept-maps){reference-type="ref"
reference="sec-bg-concept-maps"}, concept maps are an appropriate way to
understand and assess sense-making and change in knowledge structures.
In this study, participants will produce concept maps whenever they are
working on an information search task. An appropriate browser based
concept-mapping tool will be used for this purpose. The "Sero!"
platform[^1] is a promising choice for this purpose. Sero! "uses concept
mapping for knowledge and learning assessment" and "facilitates
big-picture comprehension and gives educators deeper insight into
students' thinking".

## Search Task Template {#sec-method-search-task-template}

![ Template for each search task, adapted from the *Information in
Cyberspace* course at the UT Austin School of Information. Phrases
enclosed in \[\[square brackets\]\] will be modified for individual
tasks. ](figs/search-task-template.pdf){#fig-search-task-template
width="\\linewidth"}

Participants of the longitudinal study will be performing several search
tasks throughout the duration of the semester (Section
[1.4](#sec-method-procedure){reference-type="ref"
reference="sec-method-procedure"}). The search tasks mentioned will
generally be on the topics of the material taught in the course. The
generic template for each search task is presented in Figure
[1.2](#fig-search-task-template){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig-search-task-template"}, and is adapted from the
*Information in Cyberspace* course. The words or phrases enclosed in
\[\[square brackets\]\] will be appropriately modified when the study
site is finalized.

## Procedure {#sec-method-procedure}

![ Overview of the study procedure.
](figs/study-procedure.pdf){#fig-study-procedure width="\\linewidth"}

The longitudinal study will consist of six data collection stages, as
outlined in FigureÂ [1.3](#fig-study-procedure){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig-study-procedure"}. Each of these stages are described
below.

### SUR1: Entry Survey {#sec-method-sur1}

Participants will be recruited for the study via the entry survey
\[SUR1\]. The description of the study and the link to the survey will
be posted in the Learning Management System used for the course
(Canvas). The entry survey will serve dual purpose: recruit
participants, as well as capture their individual-differences, or
moderating variables. This is done so as to avoid having to capture all
of this information in the initial session (SES1), which would have made
the SES1 session overly long. Details of the data captured in SUR1 are
described below, with references to sections in the Appendix, where the
full-text of the questionnaire can be found.

1.  **Consent Form:** The first page of the entry survey will be the
    online consent form for participating in the study. Participants
    will be able to proceed once they provide consent.

2.  **Demographics:** (Appendix
    [\[app-demographics\]](#app-demographics){reference-type="ref"
    reference="app-demographics"}) demographic information

3.  **Search and IT proficiency:** (Appendix
    [\[app-search-it-proficiency\]](#app-search-it-proficiency){reference-type="ref"
    reference="app-search-it-proficiency"}) Captures previous search
    experience, and proficiency in navigating the web. Some items are
    adapted from the *Digital Health Literacy Instrument (DHLI)* by
    [@van2017development], and the *Search Self-Efficacy scale (SSE)* by
    [@brennan2016factor].

4.  **Course Load and other engagements:** (Appendix
    [\[app-course-load\]](#app-course-load){reference-type="ref"
    reference="app-course-load"}) To determine how busy the participant
    will be in the semester, and how much time they plan to allocate for
    the course with which the study is integrated. This will help to
    establish the learner's context.

5.  **Note-taking Strategies:** (Appendix
    [\[app-note-taking-strategies\]](#app-note-taking-strategies){reference-type="ref"
    reference="app-note-taking-strategies"}) Captures styles and
    strategies used by participants to take notes. Adapted from
    *Listening and Note Taking Survey* by
    [@note-taking-survey-penn-state], and *Note Taking Strategies
    Inventory* by [@note-taking-strategies-umass].

6.  **Motivation:** (Appendix
    [\[app-imi\]](#app-imi){reference-type="ref" reference="app-imi"})
    Adapted from the *Intrinsic Motivation Inventory (IMI)* by
    [@ryan1982control], which is a multidimensional measurement device
    intended to assess participants' subjective experience related to a
    target activity (the assignments for the course they are taking).
    The instrument assesses participants' interest/enjoyment, perceived
    competence, effort/importance, pressure/tension, perceived choice,
    and value/usefulness, while performing a given activity, thus
    yielding six subscale scores. Three items in the value/usefulness
    subscale will be completed with contextual information when the
    study site is finalized. The pressure/tension and the perceived
    choice components will not be included in the entry survey, and will
    be present in the mid-term \[SUR2\] and exit \[SUS3\] surveys.

7.  **Self-regulation:** (Appendix
    [\[app-srq\]](#app-srq){reference-type="ref" reference="app-srq"})
    Adapted from the *Self-Regulation Questionnaire (SRQ)* by
    [@brown1999self], which assess seven self-regulatory processes
    through self-report: receiving relevant information, evaluating the
    information and comparing it to norms, triggering change, searching
    for options, formulating a plan, implementing the plan, and
    assessing the plan's effectiveness (Section
    [\[sec-bg-learn-self-regulation\]](#sec-bg-learn-self-regulation){reference-type="ref"
    reference="sec-bg-learn-self-regulation"}).

8.  **Metacognition:** (Appendix
    [\[app-mai\]](#app-mai){reference-type="ref" reference="app-mai"})
    Adapted from the *Metacognivite Awareness Inventory (MAI)*,
    originally proposed by [@schraw1994assessing] as a 52-item true /
    false questionnaire, and later revised by [@terlecki2018call] to use
    five-point Likert scales. The instrument measures two components of
    cognition through self-report: knowledge about cognition, and
    regulation of cognition (Section
    [\[sec-bg-learn-metacognition\]](#sec-bg-learn-metacognition){reference-type="ref"
    reference="sec-bg-learn-metacognition"}).

After completing the entry survey, participants will be asked to prepare
for the initial synchronous session, \[SES1\], by *(i)* installing
Firefox web browser and the YASBIL extension on their machines, *(ii)*
get a quick introduction to concept maps (by watching a short video),
and *(iii)* familiarising themselves with the *Sero!* learning platform
(for creating and assessing concept maps). This is a one-time step. If a
participant cannot find the time for this step, they will be informed
that an extra 5-10 minutes will be taken in the beginning of SES1 to
complete this step.

The entry survey and the software installation is expected to take about
10-15 minutes to complete. Participants will be compensated with USD 5
for their time for completing this step. The survey will be floated in
the first week of the semester, and will be closed after sufficient a
number participants have been recruited.

### SES1: Initial Session

![ Prompts for the search task repeated in Initial Session \[SES1\] and
Final Session \[SES3\].
](figs/search-task-repeated.pdf){#fig-search-task-repeated
width="\\linewidth"}

For the Initial Session, (aka SES1), participants will be invited to a
remote study session over a video-conferencing platform (Zoom). The
purpose of the the pre-test will be to establish baseline search
behaviour and domain knowledge of the participants. The study will
consist of a training task, two actual search tasks, one website
reliability assessment, and a memory span test. Each of these components
are described below.

1.  **Training Task:** Participants will perform a training task to
    familiarize themselves with how to operate the YASBIL browser
    extension to log their browsing activity, and how to create concept
    maps while they are searching. The training task is expected to take
    around 5-10 minutes.

2.  **Two Search Tasks:** Participants will perform two search tasks, of
    which one will be repeated in the final session \[SES3\] at the end
    of the semester, and the other will not be repeated. This will help
    to answer research question RQ2 (Section
    [\[sec-rq\]](#sec-rq){reference-type="ref" reference="sec-rq"}). The
    order of the two search tasks will be randomized. The generic format
    the search tasks are described in Figure
    [1.2](#fig-search-task-template){reference-type="ref"
    reference="fig-search-task-template"}.

    The repeated search task will be on the topic of financial literacy,
    a topic that may be considered to be universally important to
    college students, and part of lifelong learning. The SES1 and SES3
    versions of the repeated task are presented in Figure
    [1.4](#fig-search-task-repeated){reference-type="ref"
    reference="fig-search-task-repeated"}. The non-repeated search task
    will be on topics that will be taught in the course serving as the
    site for the study. Examples of search tasks used in the Pilot Study
    are in Appendix
    [\[ch-pilot-study\]](#ch-pilot-study){reference-type="ref"
    reference="ch-pilot-study"}. Each search task is expected to take
    around 20 minutes.

    To answer RQ3 (effect of externalisation and articulation in
    learning), each participant will perform one of the search tasks
    while thinking aloud (concurrent think-aloud, or *CTA condition*),
    and perform the other one in silence (*silent condition*). The
    choice of the task for each of the conditions will be randomized and
    balanced.

    Each search task will begin with a pre-task questionnaire (Appendix
    [\[app-pre-task-qsn\]](#app-pre-task-qsn){reference-type="ref"
    reference="app-pre-task-qsn"}), which asks participants to self-rate
    their pre-search topic knowledge and interest. Then participants
    will turn on the YASBIL browsing logger and start searching. The
    deliverable for each search task will be a written summary
    (artefact), and a concept map. After participants are satisfied with
    the quality of the deliverable, they will turn off YASBIL browsing
    logger, and proceed to the post-task questionnaire. The post-task
    questionnaire (Appendix
    [\[app-post-task-qsn\]](#app-post-task-qsn){reference-type="ref"
    reference="app-post-task-qsn"}) asks participants to self-rate their
    post-search topic knowledge, search experience, interest and
    motivation, and overall perceptions. The pre-task and post-task
    questionnaires are adapted from
    [@collins2016assessing; @crescenzi2020adaptation]. After the two
    search tasks are completed, participants will answer questions about
    whether they preferred the think-aloud condition or the silent
    condition, and why (Appendix
    [\[app-cta-v\-silent\]](#app-cta-v-silent){reference-type="ref"
    reference="app-cta-v-silent"}).

3.  **Webpage Comparison Assessment:** To assess participants'
    (mis)information evaluation capabilities, they will perform a
    Website Comparison assessment created by the
    [@sheg2021webpage-comparison]. This task asks students to compare
    two websites and select the one that they would use to begin
    research on a topic. One of the pages is a Wikipedia article. The
    other has ".edu" in its URL, but the page reveals that the content
    is a student-written blog post created as part of a university
    course. Many students have been taught that Wikipedia pages are
    completely unreliable and should be avoided. Many have also been
    taught that sites with a .edu domain are trustworthy. This
    assessment gauges their ability to think in more nuanced ways about
    these kinds of sites. The website reliability assessment is expected
    to take 10 minutes.

4.  **Memory Span Test:** The session will conclude with the assessment
    of the participant's working memory capacity (WMC) using a memory
    span task [@francis2004coglab]. Memory span assessment is kept in
    the synchronous session because it is a timed task, and needs to
    conducted in a controlled (experimenter observed) condition.

Participants will be asked to share their screen for the whole duration
of the session. Their screens and audio will be recorded for the entire
duration. They may choose to turn off their video. The total time for
SES1 is expected to not exceed 1.5 hours (90 minutes). Participants will
be compensated with USD 25 for this session.

### SES2: Longitudinal Tracking

The longitudinal tracking \[SES2\] will be conducted asynchronously over
the duration of the semester, to understand the change (or lack thereof)
of participants' search behaviour and knowledge gain over time. Whenever
participants will work on different parts of their final project
research paper (which will be termed as SES2a, SES2b, ...etc.), as
described in Figure
Â [1.1](#fig-final-project-description){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig-final-project-description"}, they will use Firefox web
browser, and will log their browsing activity using the YASBIL browsing
logger. To protect their privacy, participants will be instructed to
turn YASBIL on only when they are searching for information related to
the course. In addition to the submitted working-draft of their research
paper, participants will submit a cumulative concept map with each
document submission. The cumulative concept map will help to track
participants' evolution of knowledge about the final project topic(s)
over the course of the semester. Participants will receive reminder
emails before the deadline of each assignment, to remind them to use
Firefox, turn YASBIL on, and incrementally update the concept map.
Participants will receive USD 5 per each assignment for which they log
data, up to a maximum of USD 20 for four assignments.

### SUR2: Mid-Term Survey {#sec-method-sur2}

The mid-term survey \[SUR2\] will take place around the mid point of the
semester (Week 8-9). The purpose is to track whether any of the
participants' individual difference measures (e.g. motivation,
metacognition, course load etc.) changed during the first half of the
semester. This survey will essentially be a replica of the Entry Survey
\[SUR1\] (Section [1.4.1](#sec-method-sur1){reference-type="ref"
reference="sec-method-sur1"}), with two modifications. First, the
consent form and the demographics sections will be absent. Second,
Intrinsic Motivation Inventory (IMI) will include the 'pressure/tension'
and the 'perceived choice' subscales, as these scales are more
meaningful after an activity has taken place [@ryan1982control]. The IMI
will also be reworded to reflect the mid-point of the semester (Appendix
[\[app-midterm-survey\]](#app-midterm-survey){reference-type="ref"
reference="app-midterm-survey"}). Participants will be compensated with
USD 5 for their time for completing this step.

### SES3: Final Session

The Final Session \[SES3\] will be similar in structure to the Initial
Session (SES1), and will take place at the end of the semester, after
all the course related tasks are completed by the student. The purpose
of the session is to record the 'evolved' search behaviour, and final
knowledge state. Participants will perform two search tasks, one website
reliability assessment task, and take the memory span test once again.
In the end, there will be a short semi-structured interview.

Of the two search tasks, the topic of one will be repeated from SES1
(financial literacy, Figure
[1.4](#fig-search-task-repeated){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig-search-task-repeated"}), while the topic of the other
will come from the course material. In both search tasks, participants
will be given the option of ***not searching*** if they feel confident
enough to answer the search task questions from their prior knowledge.
The deliverables for each search-task will be a written summary
(artefact) and a concept map (Figure
[1.2](#fig-search-task-template){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig-search-task-template"}).

Following the two search task, participants will perform another website
comparison/reliability task created by the
[@sheg2021webpage-comparison], which will assess their evolved
information evaluation skills. Then they will retake the memory span
test [@francis2004coglab].

A semi-structured interview will be conducted in the end, where
participants will reflect on their overall searching and learning
experience. Certain 'interesting' handpicked sessions from their
submitted logs may be identified and questions about them can also be
asked to participants. A list of the interview questions asked in the
Pilot Study (Appendix
[\[ch-pilot-study\]](#ch-pilot-study){reference-type="ref"
reference="ch-pilot-study"}) are presented in Appendix
[\[app-post-task-interview\]](#app-post-task-interview){reference-type="ref"
reference="app-post-task-interview"}, which can be reused.

Similar to SES1, participants will be asked to share their screen for
the whole duration of the session, except for the interview, whence they
can stop screen-sharing. Their screens and audio will be recorded for
the same. They may choose to turn off their video. The total time for
SES3 is expected to not exceed 1.5 hours (90 minutes). Participants will
be compensated with USD 25 for this session, and will be asked to
complete the Exit Survey \[SUR3\] as soon as convenient.

### SUR3: Exit Survey

The exit survey \[SUR3\] will take place after the Final Session
\[SES3\]. The purpose is to record the final state of the participants'
individual difference measures (e.g. motivation, metacognition, course
load etc.), and whether they changed during the second half of the
semester. This survey will essentially be a replica of the mid-term
survey \[SUR2\] (Section [1.4.4](#sec-method-sur2){reference-type="ref"
reference="sec-method-sur2"}), with the Intrinsic Motivation Inventory
(IMI) reworded to reflect the end-point of the semester (Appendix
[\[app-final-survey\]](#app-final-survey){reference-type="ref"
reference="app-final-survey"}). Participants will be compensated with
USD 5 for their time for completing this step. If participants do not
take the survey within three days (say) after appearing for SES3, they
will be sent reminder emails.

Participants will be compensated with a bonus payment of USD 15, if they
complete all the parts of the study without missing any component.

## Measurement and Variables

### Independent / Explanatory: Search Interaction and Process Measures

The independent variables will be the search process behavioural
measures. Information searching behaviour will be operationalized using
a battery of search process measures, based on the three-stages of user
interaction discussed in Section
[\[sec-bg-search-3\-stage\]](#sec-bg-search-3-stage){reference-type="ref"
reference="sec-bg-search-3-stage"}. These measures include query
reformulation types and measures
(TableÂ [\[tab-res-Q\-QRT-txnmy\]](#tab-res-Q-QRT-txnmy){reference-type="ref"
reference="tab-res-Q-QRT-txnmy"}), SERP examination measures, content
page examination measures, and overall search session measures (Table
[\[tab-search-behaviours\]](#tab-search-behaviours){reference-type="ref"
reference="tab-search-behaviours"}). A non-exhaustive list of such
search process measures which have been used in prior literature is
presented in Appendices
[\[sec-app-vars-qry\]](#sec-app-vars-qry){reference-type="ref"
reference="sec-app-vars-qry"} through
[\[sec-app-vars-overall-search\]](#sec-app-vars-overall-search){reference-type="ref"
reference="sec-app-vars-overall-search"}.

### Dependant / Outcome: Learning Measures

Learning (knowledge gain) will constitute the dependant variables, or
factor variables, when dichotomized via median split. Learning outcomes
are planned to be assessed by: *(i)* analysis of concept maps
[@halttunen2005assessing] (Appendix
[\[sec-app-vars-concept-maps\]](#sec-app-vars-concept-maps){reference-type="ref"
reference="sec-app-vars-concept-maps"}); *(ii)* analysis of written
summaries / knowledge artefacts [@wilson2013comparison]; and *(iii)*
instructor awarded scores and grades received by students in the course,
which will be obtained via FERPA release. Time, resources and
feasibility permitting, other possible ways of assessing learning can be
by using *(iv)* Online Research and Comprehension Assessment (ORCA)
[@leu2015new Table 3], [@kanniainen2021assessing Appendix A]; and *(v)*
information-use from websites in written artefacts
[@vakkari2019modeling; @vakkari2020usefulness].

### Moderator: Individual Differences

The variables of individual differences that are hypothesized to
moderate learning are *(i)* motivation, scored using Intrinsic
Motivation Inventory (IMI) [@ryan1982control]; *(ii)* self-regulation,
scored using Self-Regulation Questionnaire (SRQ) [@brown1999self];
*(iii)* metacognition, scored using revised Metacognivite Awareness
Inventory (MAI) [@schraw1994assessing; @terlecki2018call] *(iv)* memory
span, scored using memory span test [@francis2004coglab]; *(v)* search
proficiency, scored using Digital Health Literacy Instrument (DHLI)
[@van2017development] and Search Self-Efficacy Scale (SSE)
[@brennan2016factor]; *(vi)* information evaluation capabilities
(mastery / emerging / beginner), scored according to rubrics provided by
[@sheg2021webpage-comparison] assessments (an example grading rubric is
present in Appendix
[\[sec-app-pilot-ses3\]](#sec-app-pilot-ses3){reference-type="ref"
reference="sec-app-pilot-ses3"} Task 3).

## Data Analysis Plans

Exploratory data analysis (such as time series plotting) and descriptive
statistics will be used to identify if changes in search process /
interaction measures can be visually observed over the course of time.
Inferential statistics (difference between groups) will be employed to
test if there are significant differences in the learning measures
between student groups who learn more versus learn less. Pattern Mining
and clustering approaches may also be used to identify clusters or
patterns in the search process (time-series) data, and see if these
clusters correlate with high and low learning. An example of measuring
such changes in variables can be found in [@133 Section 3.2]. Advanced
search interactions such as parallel browsing behaviour (multi-tabbed
and multi-windowed browsing) may also be analysed
[@huang2010parallel; @labaj2012modeling].

## Anticipated Limitations

There are foreseeable limitations to this proposed longitudinal study.
First, there may not be enough participants who sign up for the study.
The remedy for this is choosing a course with a large number of
students, and using appealing messaging in the recruitment material
(e.g., an attractive video message was used to recruit participants in
the Pilot Study[^2]). Second, participants may drop off due to various
reasons during the study. This can be tackled by regularly communicating
with the participants, keeping them engaged with affectionate, caring
and encouraging messaging, and letting them know that their
participation is valued highly by the researchers. Third, participants
may not show any changes in their search behaviours, of the changes may
be random. As one anonymous reviewer put it "the smart kids will show up
smart and with good search skills and they will leave smart with good
search skills and they will not change their inherent behavior over the
time. Similarly, the dumb kids will show up dumb, do whatever keeps them
dumb and end up dumb." Alternatively, there may be are not changes over
time, but rather strategies that are consistently followed by students
who will learn more, and students who will learn less. There is no easy
fix to this, and if this happens, it will be treated as a finding from
the study. A possible rescue from this situation would then be to use
the (semi) qualitative data -- the semi structured interview at the end,
the concurrent think alouds, and others -- to derive interesting
findings.
