# SUR2: Midterm Survey {#app_midterm_survey}

## Overall Instructions:

*You may have seen these questions before. We ask you to carefully
consider the questions again, reflect back on your activities and
experiences since the beginning of the semester, and answer the
questions accordingly. We all grow and evolve with time. These questions
will help us to understand how you have evolved over the past few
weeks.*
